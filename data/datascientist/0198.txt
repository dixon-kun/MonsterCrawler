        About J\.P\. Morgan Corporate &amp; Investment Bank
        J\.P\. Morgan&#8217;s Corporate &amp; Investment Bank \(CIB\) is a global leader in Banking\. The world&#8217;s corporations, governments and institutions entrust us with their business in more than 100 countries\. The Corporate &amp; Investment Bank supports our clients around the world providing strategic advice, raising capital and managing risk\.
        Who we are
        We are a small, focused team of passionate engineers, data and business people and designers set on creating and building products that transform the way we and our clients do business\.
        Sure, we are part of a large financial services firm operating in a highly\-regulated environment, and that means we are not as flexible or agile as your average company &#8211; let alone a startup\. But we are careful stewards of our clients&#8217; trust and money and combine creativity and speed with discipline and awareness\.
        It also means that what we build matters and have huge impact; our products and solutions will reach our 1000s of clients around the world, and affect how J\.P\. Morgan does business &#8211; from trading securities in multiple markets to moving trillions of dollars a day\. We won&#8217;t build it unless we know it is scalable\.
        We are obsessed with effectiveness, productivity and efficiency; if we find an issue or broken process, we fix it\. We work with the right tools, make decisions quickly, and only pursue those ideas that can scale and meet our clients&#8217; and our business&#8217; critical needs\.
