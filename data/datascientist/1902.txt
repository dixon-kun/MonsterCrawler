Your team will also work on developing tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration.

             Partner with teams such as Product Management, Engineering, and Design to collaborate on initiatives across the company
             Work with the data science management team to develop new initiatives and improve existing processes across the entire Data Science organization
             Work closely with Recruiting to expand the team, including sourcing candidates, interviewing, participating in conferences/events, and on-boarding new employees
           Requirements:
             5+ years of industry experience in data science or a related field
             2+ years of experience in managing data science teams or track record of data science leadership excellence
