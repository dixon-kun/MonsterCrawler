               Position Description:&#13;
Box is looking for a lead Interaction Designer to craft exceptional digital experience design for the in-house creative team at Box. We're looking for a great talent and great partner that will take point on understanding customer needs and behavior and using insights to craft experiences that work and delight.&#13;
Please note: this is a marketing and creative role, not a product development role.&#13;
&#13;
At Box, designers work cross-functionally to shape and steer how our brand interfaces with the world. As part of our in-house creative lab, the interaction design lead works closely with writers, visual designers, content strategists, data scientists and campaign managers to bring user-centric thinking and digital performance orientation into digital marketing programs. Specifically, the interaction design lead is responsible for crafting insights-driven personas, define experience flows across temporal experiences, and lead out the creation of wireframes and similar artifacts to drive a comprehensive view of the creative program. As programs reach certain checkpoints, the interaction designer takes lead on usability testing, and partners closely with the marketing operations team to ensure the learning agenda carries into the metrics within the marketing dashboard.&#13;
&#13;
The optimal candidate will be the voice of the customer in the experience, while continuously championing the brand in the engagement. You should be able to cogently think through the modern requirements of social engagement, distributed application and content development, and using marketing as a service rather than a bland sales tactic.&#13;
