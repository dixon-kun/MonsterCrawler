        About Freebird:
Freebird empowers travelers to instantly and seamlessly get back on their way when life throws a wrench into their travel plans. Combining technology, data science, and a fresh take on travel UX, we&#8217;re tackling the age-old problem of flight delays and cancellations. With Freebird, travelers have the ability to rebook their disrupted flight in less than 30 seconds -- at no additional cost. Our product immediately notifies customers of travel issues on their itineraries, helps them find the best alternative flight/route in real time, and gives them the ability to instantly book a new ticket -- for free -- in just 3 taps.
We launched in August 2015 and raised $3.5MM in seed funding from General Catalyst, Accomplice, and Slow Ventures in November 2015.
About the Role:
   &#8226; You&#8217;ll be applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to create scalable solutions for fun &amp; well-defined problems. We have incredible data on flight histories, airport slowdowns, mechanical trouble, weather, and everything else you could imagine that causes flight hassles.
   &#8226; You&#8217;ll work closely with the engineering team to create and deploy your models efficiently.
   &#8226; You&#8217;ll get to design experiments to answer targeted questions on every aspect of Freebird&#8217;s operations.
Sound like you?
   &#8226; You have experience managing end-to-end machine learning pipelines: you&#8217;ll be working with GB- to TB-sized datasets, and take charge from data exploration and model building to performance evaluation and optimization.
   &#8226; You&#8217;ve mastered one of Python, R, Scala (the Berkeley stack), or Java, but broader experience is always a plus.
   &#8226; You&#8217;re familiar with standard software development practices (unit testing, agile, continuous deployment) and have experience working in a production environment.
About Our Culture:
We&#8217;re a small team of product, technology, and travel enthusiasts that are passionate about building a delightful customer experience. We believe that empowering customers starts with empowering employees, and share common values of trust, transparency, empathy. If you&#8217;re an ambitious, smart, natural collaborator who likes learning new technologies and is interested in working with a small, core team, we&#8217;d love to talk to you about joining Freebird.
Interested? Send us your resume and a short note letting us know why you&#8217;d be a great fit for our team.
