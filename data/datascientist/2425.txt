         Position Summary
         Customer Promise enables Walmart's ecommerce business to make and keep promises to its customer in our global market by delivering the next generation of supply chain. The Inventory Management group is responsible for the inbound inventory for the entire Walmart.com and is comprised of Forecasting, Replenishment, and Allocation. The Forecasting team generates data science models to predict demand for any given item at any given point of time. The Replenishment team uses this information as well as others to perform optimizations at a more holistic level. They then formulate a plan that looks at current inventory in real-time across various categories and items. The Allocation team takes care of allocating the inventory across various fulfillment centers so that inventory sits close to demand. They do this taking various factors into consideration like, space available, geography, restrictions and security. With our product offerings increasing daily, this all has to be done to scale optimizing 100&#8217;s of thousands of SKU&#8217;s and multiple fulfillment centers. These highly available and responsive systems drive the entire inventory management of Walmart.com.
