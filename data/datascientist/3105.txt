          We are hiring Scientific Software Developers with a passion for software development, software engineering, and scientific computing. These individuals will work with teams of engineers, scientists, and system administrators to solve engineering problems on the Naval Reactors (NR) Program's High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.
          Primary job responsibilities focus on HPC scientific software stack management. This work includes collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams to develop, deploy, and maintain a variety of HPC scientific software consisting of both external (open-source) and internal computational libraries and engineering utilities. As experience is gained, the individual will provide consultation for and facilitate training in various scientific computing disciplines including, but not limited to, compiler operation and optimization, automation (scripting), parallel programming, profiling, and debugging.
          This individual will split time with ~75% applied to support the development and deployment of production engineering applications and ~25% applied to research and develop new processes, methods, and algorithms in scientific computing for the NR Program's supercomputers, especially targeting middleware and hardware changes. Overall, this work focuses on parallel algorithms and numerical methods applied to nuclear reactor physics, fluid dynamics / thermal-hydraulics, solid mechanics / materials science, and data science in support of the design and analysis of Naval nuclear propulsion plants.
