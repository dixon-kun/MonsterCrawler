        We are an agile, product-driven, initiative-based team crafting the next generation of fashion personalization algorithms. We use our customer's behavior to gain deeper insights into our members' preferences, extract new information from product images and descriptions, and find the best ways to serve as personal stylists for our fashion-savvy customers.

        Today, you
        * enjoy transforming raw data into features and predictors, and are experienced in statistical modeling and can robustly build, evaluate and monitor models.
        * use variety of algorithms for recommendations, classification, regression, and feature extraction, from logistic regression to matrix factorization, to deep learning neural networks.
        * are proficient with your tools of choice (e.g. R, Python/scikit-learn, Scala/Spark/mllib), with SQL
        * have worked with compiled and scripting languages.
        You'll be joining the Gilt Tech organization. You should love small, autonomous teams, decentralized decision making, Scala, functional programming, open source technologies, distributed systems, continuous delivery, simplicity, and automation!
