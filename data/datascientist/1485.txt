        The Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech (BI) broadly integrates disciplines &#8211; from molecular science to policy analysis &#8211; to address pressing challenges to human health, habitat, and well-being. We use an information biology approach to predict, explain, and visualize the behavior of massively interacting systems. The institute guides emergency response to epidemics, makes urban infrastructure more sustainable, and accelerates the discovery of treatments for chronic diseases.
