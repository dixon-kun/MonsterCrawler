           Principal&#160;Data Science Engineer
           Job Type:
          Full-Time
          Location:
         San Francisco, CA
          Department:
         Engineering
          At
           OpenTable
          , we take pleasure in Software Design. We believe that velocity comes from a commitment to clean code and solid engineering principles. We deliver innovative products through rapid, continuous development. We are passionate about building small, independent product development teams &#8211; product managers, designers and engineers working together empowered to make their own decisions.
         OpenTable is looking for an experienced, impact-driven Software Engineer to join our team. &#160; In this role you will work closely with our product management, user experience, and engineering teams to build a next-generation recommendation platform that help Diners make confident decisions about their next meal out. Your role will be part architect and part systems builder, responsible for building a reliable, performant recommendation system that can be quickly modified as new product requirements come in, and will scale to tens of millions of users.
          About you:
         You want to fuse your interest in how people make decisions, with building well-designed software. &#160;You care deeply about providing value to customers through product-driven features, performance, uptime, and elegant systems design. &#160;You are excited about the problems of local search, recommendations, and analyzing large amounts of heterogenous data to build indexes and models for fast query response times. &#160;You care about the details and you like to understand the systems you build fully, even if that means popping open a 3rd party library or reading through services you aren&#8217;t directly responsible for.
          Responsibilities:
            Design, architect, implement, and debug robust, high-volume production recommendation systems
            Implement and integrate data ingestion, ETL, analysis and data-mining systems
            Implement monitoring and introspection tools
            Keep this mission-critical system up with high availability
         Requirements:
            BS/MS in CS or solid understanding of computer science and software development from work experience
            Extensive programming experience (8-10+ years, though not necessarily professionally)
            Strong competencies in platform/backend service technologies, data structures, software design, and profiling
            Experience with databases (PostgreSQL in particular), Information Retrieval technologies (Lucene &amp; Elastic Search in particular), and cloud computing tool chains
            Expert knowledge developing, debugging, profiling, and load-testing Java services
         Bonus points if you have
            Experience with "big-data" frameworks such as Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Scalding, and Spark
            Experience with Machine Learning approaches.
