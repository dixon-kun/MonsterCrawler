           Inspired
          We do what we love and are connected to something greater than ourselves.
           Entrepreneurial
          We are creators, leaders and self-starters.&#160;We try new things, we challenge convention, and we&#8217;re not afraid to fail.
           Authentic
          We are genuine to our brand, mission and values.&#160;We&#8217;re not perfect and we don&#8217;t pretend to be.&#160;We are, though, always honest and as transparent as we can be.
