          Our goal is to make the human genome practically useful for life-altering decisions.
          We invented the Counsyl Test, a breakthrough diagnostic intended for parents planning to start a family. The test won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine, was named one of Scientific American&#8217;s &#8220;Top 10 World Changing Ideas&#8221;, was featured in the New York Times -- and is now prescribed by physicians for over 3% of all the births in the United States.
          Few if any have done genetics on this scale before. As a data scientist, you will play a critical role in building an efficient, reliable, and data-driven vertically-integrated genetics organization.
           What you'll do:
             Build structured reports that can be automatically re-run to monitor critical laboratory parameters for process control and regulatory compliance.
             Statistical modeling and process debugging to develop new assays and new technology in the lab.
             Assist in data analysis, modeling, and reporting for scientific publications.
             Cross-functional analysis: work with the business and sales development teams to optimize revenue using our large corpus of historical sales and insurance data.
             Coordinate between the laboratory and operations teams to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the business.
           About you:
             MS or PhD in Industrial Engineering, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a similarly quantitative field; or significant prior experience in related work.
             You have a strong background in statistics and probability; experience with statistical modeling and machine learning is a plus.
             You are experienced in a statistical programming environment like Python or R, and are familiar with both statistical computation and data visualization in your environment of choice (e.g., matplotlib, ggplot2, etc.). Experience with modern web development is a plus. Experience with only Excel (or other spreadsheet tools) is insufficient.
             Industrial engineering or process control background is a plus.
          Counsyl is a health technology company that offers DNA screening for diseases that can impact men, women and their children. The Counsyl philosophy is simple: screen for diseases where advanced knowledge makes a difference in health outcomes, whether it&#8217;s changing a behavior, pursuing preventative measures, or simply preparing for what lies ahead.
          The Counsyl team includes an accomplished group of problem-solvers &#8212; top engineers, scientists, and designers &#8212; who are taking the lead on building the modern clinical laboratory. Scientific rigor, custom robotics, and software are at the heart of every Counsyl product, resulting in better, faster and more affordable screens that are broadly accessible. Beyond the laboratory, Counsyl offers doctors and patients a technology platform for results delivery in real time, with on-demand access to board-certified genetic counselors.
          Counsyl has screened more than 700,000 patients and served more than 6,000 health care professionals in its CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited and NYS CLEP-permitted clinical laboratory. The company has raised a total of $102 million and is privately backed by Pilot Growth Equity, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Founders Fund, Felicis Ventures, David Drummond, and other high profile investors.
