           About the Position
          We never rest in our quest to capture the most relevant and timely data possible. Our software engineers work at the tip of the FiscalNote spear, continuously aggregating large quantities of real-time open data. FiscalNote data scientists and policy experts rely on our software engineers to formulate and implement inventive methods of data collection in order to provide the top-tier analysis expected by our customers.
          Data acquisition is only the beginning, though. Excitement about building tools and frameworks to assess and address data issues is a basic characteristic of our software engineers. You will not be silo-ed, but rather, encouraged to reveal and attack any issues that need dealing with, data-related or not. You will be given the freedom to explore our business and our technology&#8230; and make it better. If you want to be empowered to work beyond basic expectations and join an engineering team energized to create what&#8217;s never been seen, you&#8217;re the ideal FiscalNote engineer.
