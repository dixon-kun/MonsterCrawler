               About this company
              HCL Technologies Ltd.
                At the dawn of the new millennium, a unique information technology   company was born: HCL Technologies. As narrated in the video below, HCL   Technologies has demonstrated remarkable growth through the recent   economic downturn, emerging as one of only eight 21st century listed   technology companies in the world to cross
                 $1bn in Net Profit, $6bn in Revenue and $15bn in Market Capitalization.
                 This was possible because we believe that real value lies in the   relationship created between customer and provider, which is built on   three deeply rooted value systems:
                  We put
                  ,   empowering them to believe in everyday ideas that create immense value   for our customers, making HCL Technologies the world's largest
                   Ideapreneurship&#8482;
                  .
                  Our fixation on
                    Value Centricity
                  is dedicated to delivering more value for our clients, putting their interests ahead of ours and delivering value that goes beyond the contract.
                  Our belief in
                    Trust, Transparency and Flexibility
                  drives us to step into our customers' business reality, guaranteeing outcomes with great enthusiasm.
                 While we pride our eye to detail in constructing robust contracts with clients, we realize that only a
                 can capture what will change tomorrow.
                 The management's role at HCL Technologies is to empower employees to believe in the power of ideas - a culture we call
                 .   Helping clients from all spheres of work through innovative technology   solutions, Ideapreneurs are transforming global businesses - one   relationship at a time.
                Over the years, we have seen these values manifest in the form of platforms such as the
                  Value Portal
                ,   where front line employees have generated and implemented ideas that   have unlocked close to $600mn of unforeseen business value for our   customers. Or
                  MAD JAM,
                a celebration of employee-seeded ideas that are nurtured by leaders and harvested into successful business offerings.
                We believe that our deeply ingrained value system has helped us win multiple
                ,   establishing us as a leading IT provider among our Indian peers. These   awards include the ICSI Corporate Governance Award, Best Governed   Company from the Asia Center for Corporate Governance and the CNBC   Outstanding Company of the Year Award.
