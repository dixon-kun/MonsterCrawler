            External and Internal
           In ATT Labs' Big Data Research organization, we develop new methods for analyzing massive data sets to learn about our network and our customers, and to improve services and operations. We are a pioneer in big data technologies &#8211; developing &#160;novel methodologies for statistical computing, event prediction, fraud detection, visualization, text mining, data stream management, data quality and anomaly detection, and privacy preserving measures such as data anonymization.
           We are looking for strong analysts in a data science field with a passion for extracting insights from large data sets.&#160; We work on problems that cut across all aspects of ATT's business, including network and service management, marketing and customer care, network design and optimization, and new service creation.&#160; Many analysts work directly with business unit leaders.&#160; &#160;All have opportunities to invent novel, publishable methodology that address real-world problems.&#160; &#160;Increasingly we contribute to multiple data science disciplines through open source projects, led by ATT.
           We typically hire to fill two positions:
            Our PhD level Inventive Scientists are technical leaders in their field, establishing external recognition while creating innovative, business-impacting solutions.
            Data Scientists will usually have a Master&#8217;s; they are responsible for the entire data &#8211; to &#8211; solution pipeline.&#160; They both support the Inventive Scientists and are responsible for their own projects.
           Location can be Bedminster, NJ or New York, NY.
           Desired areas of expertise:
           - Spatiotemporal analysis of mobile data - The ATT network generates billions of records per day from handheld devices, each one providing a data point in time and space. &#160;Understanding the dynamics of this data through time series and spatial statistics helps ATT better serve its customers, improve its network, and develop new products and services.
           - Statistical computation - ATT is developing high-performance statistical models and algorithms (mostly in R) to leverage modern streaming and storage technologies. One example is the ATT collaborative coding project RCloud &#160;                  http://rcloud.social/                .
           - Text mining - ATT is modeling free-form text from millions of customer surveys, &#160;representative notes, and chats as one way to manage our business in real time. New methods are needed to keep up with the volume and complexity of this data.
           - Data visualization - ATT creates algorithms, systems, and techniques for visualizing new data sets at increasingly large scale. ATT is especially interested in interactive visualization of very large geospatial and temporal data. One example is our open source project Nanocubes
           .
           - Database management and data quality - ATT is building high-performance and low latency systems to manage high velocity data streams. These systems are critical for accurate processing and analysis of data from the ATT mobile network. Analyzing the data to identify glitches, and cleaning the data to minimize distortion while preserving maximal underlying variation, are essential to ensure meaningful big data analytics.
           - Predictive Modeling &#8211; We estimate models to predict customer behavior and sentiment, service disruptions, and event impacts.&#160; Models serve to both target, and to gain insight into variable relationships.&#160; Our rich customer and network data allows analysts to positively affect business outcomes and to pursue methodological research (comparing machine learning algorithms, for example).
