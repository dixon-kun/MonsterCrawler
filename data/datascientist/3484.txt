We&#8217;re a team of bright, driven, and experienced developers, product designers, and movie lovers and we use data to improve the way our products work and theaters operate. We&#8217;re backed by influential movie studios including Disney, Fox, and Lionsgate, and we&#8217;re bringing innovative industry-first features to market such as dynamic pricing and pre-ordering concessions. Sound like fun? Come join our team!
