          Our Team:
         The Real-Time Individualization (RTI) team is responsible for the Big Data/Machine Learning technology that drives the real-time product recommendations on Kibo&#8217;s eCommerce platform. We are a scrappy, energetic scrum team that creates working software out of the cutting-edge mathematical models created by our Data Scientists.
          You Should Apply IF:
          You want to design efficient, scalable, resilient, fast, powerful software that is poised to change the future of eCommerce.
          You are a leader with a ton of grit who is biased towards deliberate, decisive action.
          You see a problem and then own it. Then you crush it.
          You don&#8217;t take yourself too seriously.
          You don&#8217;t expect to work from home.
          Your definition of success is turning your less experienced team mates into even better engineers than you are.
          You can drive a diversely talented team towards efficient, predictable software delivery, even though they don&#8217;t report to you.
          You are unafraid to challenge our best practices and offer better solutions.
          People generally like you &#8211; even Product Managers.
          Key Responsibilities:
         Not only will you be responsible for the following -- you will also be responsible for ensuring that the whole team is being responsible for the following:
          Being smart enough to figure out the best way to do something on your own, but knowing when to ask for help and then asking for it.
          Knowing your stuff AND figuring out how to apply that knowledge to a variety of dissimilar situations and contexts AND being ready, willing, and able to teach it to someone else.
          Growing, both personally and professionally.
          When you can&#8217;t figure out what the Product Team wants based on the requirements they wrote, going to ask them about it and helping them understand the limitations of our technology when necessary.
          Creating a healthy, productive work environment that supports the success of the individuals on our team.
          Ensuring that we aren&#8217;t hacking our code, introducing other unnecessary weirdness into our systems, violating security requirements, or adding functionality that no one has asked us to work on.
          Creating and maintaining as much documentation as is needed for your someone to replicate your work easily, but not a word more.
          Being an inspiration, or at least fun to work with.
