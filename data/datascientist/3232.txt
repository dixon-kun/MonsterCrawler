        The Structural Genomics Consortium at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (SGC-UNC) and the Laboratory for Molecular Modeling at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy are interested in recruiting a postdoctoral fellow in computational chemical genomics. The project entails the rational expansion of the GSK Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) to enrich the current collection of de-orphanized human protein kinases and unique chemical probes for thus kinase library. Working with researchers at SGC-UNC as well as SGC collaborators worldwide,   the successful candidate will develop comprehensive chemical genomics database of human protein kinases and their inhibitors, develop new scheme for automated detection of kinase (subfamiliy)-specific chemotypes, and develop predictive understanding of structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationships for kinase inhibitors to identify selective kinase-specific putative probe compounds.  The ultimate objective of this computational project is to prioritize new compounds for experimental testing. This postdoctoral fellow position will be part of a multidisciplinary team that includes biologists, chemists, and data scientists. The ideal candidate will have significant expertise in bioinformatics and cheminformatics, working knowledge of multivariate statistical and data mining techniques, and strong programming skills. Experience with developing and maintaining large databases is a plus.
