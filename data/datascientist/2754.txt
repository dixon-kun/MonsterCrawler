        The ALICE team is hiring!
        Alice is a project to direct Artificial Intelligence towards economic decision making. &amp;nbsp We are building tools that combine state-of-the-art machine learning with econometrics to bring automation to economic decision making. &amp;nbsp The heart of this project is a striving to measure causation: if you want to understand or make policy decisions in a complex economy, you need to know why the system moves the way it does. &amp;nbsp
        Microsoft Research has a long tradition of work at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science, and this team brings together researchers from across Social Science, Computer Science, and Machine Learning. &amp;nbsp The Alice project allows us to dramatically scale the success that we've had in adapting existing ML technology for economic applications and in developing new deep learning architectures for causal inference. &amp;nbsp All our research is tied to concrete policy-relevant applications, including work on demand estimation and price optimization, on measuring effectiveness of advertising and sales strategies, and on the design of incentives for desirable healthcare and education outcomes. &amp;nbsp The goal is to use AI to improve and democratize economic research while taking from economic theory to push the frontier of AI.
        We are looking for a Data Scientist with strong analytical and developer skills to join our team to develop industry leading machine learning solutions. Successful candidates will have several years of experience analyzing data and developing models across a breadth of technology platforms.
