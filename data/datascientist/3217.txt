          Computational Software/Data Engineer
         Morrisville, NC
         MaxPoint provides a leading business intelligence and digital marketing solution that enables national brands to drive local, in-store sales.
         The computational engineering (CE) team is looking for candidates to help support the data scientists at MaxPoint.
          In no particular order, here are examples of what that support looks like:
          Give advice about how to interpret stack traces, tune parameters, and improve transforms to get Spark jobs running smoothly.
          Design and implement tools that ease collaboration among data scientists.&#160; For example, create an Jupyter extension to make sharing notebooks easier or to manage conda environments.
          Advocate for open sourcing internal tooling that is non-competitive supporting infrastructure:
          Automate the deployment of a Python web app with a Celery worker queue using Ansible.
          Configure Jenkins to run automated tests for a Python repository using py.test.
          Write tutorials for data scientists ranging from adding interactive widgets in Jupyter notebooks to authenticating with Kerberos.
          Help maintain upstream open-source libraries by fixing bugs and implementing new features.
          Help replace legacy internal tooling with modern open-source solutions (Airflow, Dask)
          Stand at a data scientists desk helping them debug their Pandas transforms in a remote Jupyter notebook
          Review pull requests from data scientists and engineers on Bitbucket repos to encourage best practices (testing, code quality, DRY, etc&#8230;)
          Automate the deployment of new machine learning models to production
          Help create conda packages for new (or legacy) Python code
          Help MaxPoint make the move to Python 3
          Respond to questions about best practices and deployment/service issues in HipChat.
          Route blocking issues for the data scientists to the right supporting team (IT, Ops, Engineering)
          Be the subject matter expert: Other teams will come to us for technical advice
          We'd like to talk to you if you have any of the following:
          At least 5 years of experience working autonomously in data-driven computing fields (or at least 2-3 years of experience if you have also have a PhD)
          Expertise in scientific computing tools for Python, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc., and your peers turn to you for guidance in this area
          A strong interest (and preferably industry expertise) in Spark and Scala &#8211; you&#8217;ll become our go-to expert in these technologies
          Experience building trust and respect among highly advanced technical teams
          A passion for knowledge-sharing, specifically the technical coaching and mentorship of your team on new technologies and best practices for development
          Significant participation in open source projects including writing code, coordinating meetups, giving tutorials, speaking at conferences, writing scientific papers, etc.
          An interest in making time during your day job to contribute to open source. For example, our team is active in the Jupyter and conda-forge communities
