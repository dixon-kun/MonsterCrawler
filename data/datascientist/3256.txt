        The Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill invites applications for the position of lecturer to begin in Fall 2017.  The position is for an initial term of four years, and is periodically renewable upon review.  We seek applications from individuals with exceptional promise for, or a proven record of, teaching introductory programming in a diverse undergraduate university environment. This position has the responsibility to teach courses that serve as on-ramps for a Computer Science major, such as introductory scientific programming, rudiments of data science for non-computer science students in the natural sciences, CS1, CS2, and object-oriented programming using well-known design patterns. In addition, this position entails updating, revising, and developing curriculum, employing innovative pedagogical methods and instructional technologies that will be effective in teaching and encouraging a diverse population of students to participate in these courses. The position will include training, supervising, and evaluating student teaching assistants.
