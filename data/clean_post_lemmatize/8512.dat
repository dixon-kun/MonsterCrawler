manufacturing engineering is responsible for designing the equipment process and data system of teslas production line improving our system through the application of experimental finding is crucial for manufacturing engineering to continue to improve the quality of our increasingly- complicated and increasingly-tuned production line
this role collaborates with other member of manufacturing engineering to improve our most-difficult manufacturing process and equipment through data science experimentation and modeling to drive tangible optimization to the production environment
in addition to designing new process with manufacturing engineers the manufacturing scientist defines and document standard technique for scientific research in the manufacturing environment the manufacturing scientist also train others to improve the sophistication and effectiveness of their scientific investigation within the organization
responsibilities
review academic and industry literature for applicable knowledge
design experiment to generate empirical optimization
analyze existing in-process data to inform process development
build mathematical model to accelerate future optimization
determine what data is collected and how on new production line
identify novel technique for instrumenting equipment to better control process
determine product characterization method for durability testing
educate others on statistical analysis and scientific investigation
collaborate daily with other member of manufacturing engineering
this is an exciting opportunity to build a world class manufacturing facility right here in the bay area tesla is a demanding and fast-paced environment where you will work on a critical subsystem of incredibly exciting product
the ideal candidate take pride in his her work analytical ability ability to explain technical issue to non-technical people and attention to detail he she appreciates an environment where superior work is encouraged noticed and rewarded and where individual carry tremendous responsibility
requirements
