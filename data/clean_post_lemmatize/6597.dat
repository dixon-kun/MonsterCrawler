the odc id graph is madepossible because of a lot of data and a lot of data science as a senior data scientist within theidentity data science ids research development team you'll be involvedin developing a best-in-class id graph that fuel the odc you will aide indeep exploratory data analysis to understand the quality of id graph data aswell a develop new machine learning algorithm to connect the data andevaluate accuracy of the link whileall project start a proof of concept ultimately you will also work withengineers to implement your solution into production you will be asked to collaboratewith engineer researcher product lead and business development to deeplyunderstand the data in the ecosystem how it is collected and the power of thedata to inform the id graph and odc data science product also you will help educate the broaderbusiness on how to think about and interact with the id graph for theirapplications
primary responsibilitiesas an individual contributor include
writing prototype codein python scala hive and spark to understand and improve our understandingof the id graph a a whole
researching andimplementing hybrid probabilistic-graph algorithm on massive amount of data
independentlyoptimizing and tweaking code and the cloud environment
identifyingopportunities for improvement in data cleansing manipulating and processingwithin existing software application and framework
understanding thebusiness asks and requirement for the identity graph then providethought-leadership in the implementation of analytical solution
collaborating withother team member and data scientist to brainstorm solution
collaborating withengineers to build scaled and supported id graph product
communicatingeffectively across team to explain the solution put in place and theimplications on the business
