description
this is a project-based position that doe not provide paid time off or benefit the length of the assignment will be approximately three month june august 2017
were seeking a research scientist in the area of computer vision video image analytics and perceptive systems who want to work on the leading edge of automation in industry such a transportation surveillance public safety and retail we are looking for a skilled dedicated teammate who belief their contribution can make the world more productive and a better place to live
research development and engineering performed by the team will include understanding need of the customer overall video imaging and sensing system design extraction of understanding from real-time video stream performing designed experiment to optimize the system and delivery of robust prototype leading to new product offering example video imaging and sensing application area are 1 system that aid intelligent transportation network and self-optimize to enhance user experience 2 surveillance system that monitor action of person and the state of object and property for public safety and retail 3 system that monitor and determine the state of production facility and workflow enabling optimization and real-time control
the research scientist will contribute to a team that will use state of the art open source tool a we a invent new method they will design and prototype novel video analysis application that intelligently extract relevant information and understanding from video data stream they will apply machine learning technique and other novel approach to use the information a part of real-world application in area such a transportation public safety and retail
they will also keep abreast of the latest development in the field by continuous learning and proactively champion promising new method relevant to the problem at hand may proactively identify new area of research and develop value-based proposal for investment in those area
the research scientist will work with existing intrapreneurship business team to develop and help commercialize highly user-centric adaptive and robust system
in addition to internal collaboration the researcher will also collaborate with academic and research institution across the country with project at ms and phd level journal and conference publication are also expected
qualifications
phd ms or bs in computer science electrical engineering mathematics statistic imaging science or other related area
the applicant should also have strong skill in software engineering with expertise in current programming matlab c++ and analytics language to generate deliverable module and prototype demonstration of their work
preference will be given to individual with demonstrated research engineering or entrepreneurial experience related to developing video image analytics technology with a focus on information and content identification and extraction
experience and knowledge in service domain such a business process outsourcing system transportation system healthcare system and financial service is valued
desired interdisciplinary skill include big data analytics modeling and simulation system design and experience with real world example
