at honeywell our people are driven by a desire to contribute be challenged and grow our people make honeywell a special company and are a key competitive advantage
honeywell aerospace ha approximately 40 000 employee around the world and 2015 revenue of 15 billion thousands of honeywell aerospace technology product and service are found on virtually every commercial defense and space aircraft worldwide we develop solution that span air traffic modernization flight and runway safety engine cockpit and cabin electronics wireless connectivity logistics and more honeywell aerospace delivers safe efficient productive and more comfortable transportation experience for manufacturer airline business and general aviation aircraft military and airport through three division air transport and regional business and general aviation and defense and space
honeywell aerospace product service and digital environment collect million of event per day and a a data driven company believe our data a great story to tell u as such we are investing heavily in our data science capability and establishing a data science analytics team chartered to build our predictive analytics capability for condition monitoring predictive aircraft maintenance optimize product performance build recommendation system for end customer the system will ingest machine data from various aircraft system maintenance and other operation data including unstructured data use machine learning and advanced analytics technique to identify and predict failure pattern and provide recommendation to end customer to avoid unplanned maintenance
as the lead data scientist for this team you would be responsible for collaborating with internal and external aircraft system subject matter expert to capture domain knowledge and building advanced analytics model to identify predict failure pattern on aircraft system you will also be responsible for mentoring and training a team of data scientist on failure prediction technique you will work with mix of open source and in-house developed tool but looking for you to help u define the best-of-breed tool set
key responsibilities include
work closely with the aircraft system team to gather understanding of data and domain knowledge
identify critical data source necessary to predict each failure type transform and fuse various data source to prepare for analytics
build advanced analytics algorithm to predict component life impending failure and recommendation system
mentoring a team of data scientist in building predictive analytics algorithm for machine component failure
work closely with external partner to transfer knowledge on aircraft predictive maintenance
speaking at conference writing and contributing to scientific paper and encouraging others to do the same
experiences and characteristics we are looking for include
self-starter with the drive to unlock the true power of big noisy messy real-world data
you have extensive demonstrable experience in building predictive analytics and condition monitoring system in industrial domain
