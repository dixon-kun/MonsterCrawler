videa llc wwwvideatv is a well-funded start-up under cox media group in buckhead lenox mall we have created an automated and data-driven approach to buying selling linear television advertising that is revolutionizing this multibillion dollar medium ad industry
we currently have a need for a hadoop backend engineer to join our r d team where you will have the opportunity to stay on the cutting edge of new technology and approach by implementing system that enable our data scientist to reason about and explore large data set our r d team writes the math and software that sit at the heart of videa's data product our software run over complex time-series data that is growing geometrically in size and variety we are quickly transitioning from batch to online learning approach to accommodate new business requirement
the r d team is a small team with a variety of concurrent project your interest largely dictate what project you will tackle the common thread among all project is that they require a high level of engineering and data management prowess due to the complexity of our challenge and growing scale of our data we are especially interested in developer to build and continue to improve our hadoop infrastructure and it interface
current project include
developing new and enhancing our current data pipeline
employing machine learning into these pipeline and plugging statistical modeling into our current predictive rating and pricing model
creating system that monitor input and performance on a real-time basis to inform stakeholder when unexpected change arise
responsibilities
design and build system that ingest clean and transform data for use by our data scientist and their model
implement new hadoop infrastructure a well a interface apis to meet the aforementioned objective
ownership of a system that is the core of our data product by providing day-to-day production support of this hadoop infrastructure
this support would include filesystem management and monitoring cluster monitoring and management and automating scripting backup and restores
troubleshoot using log and monitor should error arise
