at netflix we don't just deal with huge scale we deal with a huge diversity of scale we run thousand of application on our back-end cloud system we serve hundred of thousand of tv show and movie to million of customer across million of device distributed across thousand of device family all of which are constantly evolving and changing
the real-time analytics group at netflix build system which continuously use diverse telemetry source within our environment to sift through million of signal and arrive at actionable high-confidence decision about what's going on in our environment and what we should do about it some work we've already talked about publicly and would like to open-source includes
1 noticing when one out of thousand of server is misbehaving based on outlier detection and automatically replacing it with a new server
2 automatically detecting whether new code deployed to production is at least a performant and correct a baseline code and either accelerating deployment globally or rolling it back
3 automatically monitoring for health of application and alerting user when the application skews from normal behavior for more detail take a look at our talk at aws re invent
we see huge opportunity for using rta decision to drive automated system both to improve our ecosystem's self-healing capability but also to make it easier for engineer to understand what's most important for them to look at automatically deduce correlation and causation and notice the most minute imperceptible change in our streaming environment before our customer do
our analytics engineer build model that take advanced statistical analysis approach and machine learning technique to provide recommendation or in many case make decisive automated action in managing the production environment if extracting meaning out of a whole lot of data aka noise is fascinating to you we should talk if you like deducing and understanding control system pattern we should definitely talk
what you'll be doingyou'll work closely with operation engineer and application developer to translate infrastructure monitoring problem into intelligent algorithmsyou'll learn develop and apply new technique in the intersection of computer science statistic and mathyou'll create anomaly detection model on top of large scale multidimensional real-time streaming and batch infrastructure datayou'll bring scientific rigor and a bias to action in solving problemsyou'll be automating your work by partnering with platform engineer to design a machine learning platform to accelerate model development and productizationwhat you'll bringyou're a great communicator and can explain complicated mathematical concept to software engineersyou've got prior academic and industry experience with statistical modeling and machine learning techniquesyou've worked with statistical analysis tool like r and pythonyou've got experience with time-series analysis technique including forecasting methodologiesyou've worked with machine generated telemetry system and application metric you've deployed maintained and performance tuned machine learning model in a production environmentadded bonusexperience writing enterprise grade java scala or python codeexperience with data stream mining techniquesdigital signal processing dsp knowledge
