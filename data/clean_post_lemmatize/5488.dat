the structural genomics consortium at the university of north carolina at chapel hill sgc-unc and the laboratory for molecular modeling at the unc eshelman school of pharmacy are interested in recruiting a postdoctoral fellow in computational chemical genomics the project entail the rational expansion of the gsk published kinase inhibitor set pkis to enrich the current collection of de-orphanized human protein kinase and unique chemical probe for thus kinase library working with researcher at sgc-unc a well a sgc collaborator worldwide the successful candidate will develop comprehensive chemical genomics database of human protein kinase and their inhibitor develop new scheme for automated detection of kinase subfamiliy -specific chemotypes and develop predictive understanding of structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationship for kinase inhibitor to identify selective kinase-specific putative probe compound the ultimate objective of this computational project is to prioritize new compound for experimental testing this postdoctoral fellow position will be part of a multidisciplinary team that includes biologist chemist and data scientist the ideal candidate will have significant expertise in bioinformatics and cheminformatics working knowledge of multivariate statistical and data mining technique and strong programming skill experience with developing and maintaining large database is a plus
