the intelligence and decision technologies group develops advanced software technique for processing exploitation and dissemination of data from many type of sensor including radar electro-optic video and radio frequency a well a from people and the internet the goal is to develop and prototype analytics and architecture that support decision maker this work begin with an understanding of the workflow of intelligence analyst and military commander often through operation research operational data set are amassed to support all type of algorithm development such a multi-sensor fusion data mining graph-based network detection and entity tracking an agile development methodology then creates prototype system for data exploitation and knowledge management which are then delivered to our user community for feedback and iterative refinement the challenge of heterogeneous sensor system and overwhelmingly large data volume drive experimentation with architecture for network-centric exploitation and distributed storage and computation areas of technical staff expertise in the group include machine learning computer vision natural language processing graph analytics distributed software system analysis and development modeling and simulation software development and field experimentation
a research position is currently available to develop automated intelligence system for large multi-sensor and open source data set projects involve system design and architecture and the development of algorithm for machine learning computer vision natural language processing and graph analytics implemented on enterprise big data architecture data scientists and or software engineers architects are encouraged to apply
