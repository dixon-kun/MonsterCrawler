about protagonist technology
protagonist technology is not an ordinary analytics company or an ordinary software startup at the core of our unique solution is a rapidly emerging technology category called narrative analytics this unique human-in-the-loop technology where human analyst work in tandem with the most powerful artificial intelligence algorithm go beyond basic nlp technique like sentiment analysis text categorization etc
narratives are underlying belief and attitude that drive human behavior in commerce politics and society medium voice are multiplying fact are losing their currency and narrative are filling the void to drive people attitude and behavior global corporation and foundation contend with narrative challenge that pose great opportunity and also existential challenge to their business model these organization need new way to change the conversation build their brand and reputation and understand and activate their customer we are the only company to bring a robust data-driven solution to the analysis of narrative our growing customer list including citibank hpe microsoft starbucks wb state street global advisors mars general mills pfizer charles schwab pg e vmware the gates foundation rockefeller foundation and more all provide validation to our unique approach
at protagonist technology we have 10 year of experience with qualitative human analysis of narrative and have deep in-house expertise of how to identify analyze structure and understand narrative in news and social medium we marry that qualitative expertise with deep expertise in nlp and machine learning deep learning lstm etc to bring scale efficiency and new insight to our long-standing method through this process we deliver a more nuanced complex and valuable set of insight to our customer than traditional nlp and analytics company this vast knowledge and background in narrative position protagonist technology a a market and thought leader in this emerging category that delivers the richness of insight of traditional research with the scale and efficiency of social medium monitoring
we are a revenue-generating start-up backed by respected investor we are looking for high-energy team member who embody our value of drive generosity exploration and joy
reporting to the director of data science the senior data science engineer is responsible for building the narrative analytics tool and capability that drive automation using machine learning and network science technique to achieve operational scale and develop new solution by analyzing textual unstructured content this person will also be responsible for uncovering new insight causation correlation etc in the underlying data both numeric and textual by applying data engineering practice statistical modeling and effective visualization to present those insight the role will require flexibility in learning new statistical and mathematical model designing new experiment creating and fine-tuning model to deliver narrative analytics process automation and develop new insightful metric as a senior ds engineer this person will be mentor to other junior ds engineer and will actively work with client facing team in understanding pain point and brainstorming solution
position
the senior data science engineer in this role will work through quite a few unknown and inadequate data point that will require him her to calibrate the experiment and make and effectively communicate choice and tradeoff to the product manager and other member of his team the person also need to be aware of the vendor landscape and open source tool and technology to leverage existing capability and build new capability on top of whats available
since the path to developing the component may be difficult senior data science engineer will need to be innovative tenacious and solution-oriented to drive positive outcome this position is based in our san francisco office
