we're looking for humble but ambitious razor-sharp professional who can teach u a thing or two we promise to return the favor like u you take play seriously you're passionate about game we embrace those who see thing differently aren't afraid to experiment and who have a healthy disregard for constraint
that's where you come in
as data scientist you ll develop advanced machine learning algorithm and statistical model to solve critical problem and help deliver awesome player experience you ll partner with product team to implement data science model into live production system you ll bring fresh perspective to inform decision-making toward better player experience by translating player voice into insight using your top-notch modeling and analytic skill you ll work closely with software engineer and combine your modeling and coding skill to create tool and infrastructure to empower and level-up data science at riot
you are
educated you ve earned a bs or equivalent in statistics computer science math physics or an applied quantitative field and likely added an ms or phd in the same field to keep your bs company you re more ninja than rockstar preferring precision strike to chest-thumping grandstanding you have broad knowledge of machine learning statistic algorithm design or software engineering
experienced you ve earned badge in statistical modeling machine learning distributed system and database you understand how to architect implement deploy and maintain data science intensive application in a cloud environment you ve also aced one or more of deep learning natural language processing server architecture software engineering full stack web development visualization maybe earning a byline or two
big data passionate you have a firm grasp of sql and nosql database cloud environment streaming a well a the hadoop ecosystem hadoop hive spark you are very curious about the frontier of big data technology and committed to exploring the newest

player-focused a a gamer yourself you know the importance of listening to player need especially the implicit need that can only be uncovered by analyzing and understanding player data
you will
analyze petabyte of player data developing and testing data-fueled hypothesis extracting useful information and turning it into helpful insight that can help u improve player experience
bring data science to life by working with software engineer to architect develop and deploy production level application powered by advanced machine learning algorithm that can help u improve player experience
bring data science to people through designing prototyping and implementing new way to effectively communicate data science finding so that non-tech audience can enjoy the beauty of advanced machine learning
develop tool that will help data scientist and stakeholder more efficiently plumb the dark depth of our very deep very rich data store
bring fresh perspective and new dimension of analysis to bear on the challenge of identifying what we could do better develop algorithm and predictive model to solve critical riot games problem and validate model to ensure proper behavior
work closely with fellow data scientist and engineer to identify opportunity and improve our data ecosystem
don't forget to include a resume and cover letter we receive a lot of application but we'll notice a fun well-written intro that show u you take play seriously
