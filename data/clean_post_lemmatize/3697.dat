we're looking for a brilliant individual with deep expertise in statistic to form the cornerstone of our data science team our process give you full ownership over the project you tackle so dream big then execute well
data science at our startup is primarily concerned with understanding the dynamic of our large about 15 million match per month and complex about 140 000 active market across 700 service category and 10 000 us city product ecosystem what trend are occurring in the market what drive user behavior how can we intervene with product change to guide user activity
this generally involves careful inferential modeling over various observational datasets and challenging experimental design and analysis it usually requires much deeper statistical understanding than just applying a machine learning algorithm at a problem and hoping for result naturally in the course of thing some more ml-style prediction problem do come up
you'll work closely with engineer to get the data you need out of our various storage layer and to implement experiment in our production system you'll be given the latitude to survey our company a a business identify key opportunity and use any and all available data to draw actionable conclusion that will guide the direction of the company
requirements
you have a deep understanding of probability and statistic including but not limited to experimental design randomization and blocking error type and loss frequentist v bayesian approach bootstrapping and simulation modeling including technique for nonlinear response generalized linear model and model selection and evaluation confounding and effect modification propensity score and other technique for causal inference
you're proficient with statistical analysis in an environment tool language of your choice we use both r and python pandas currently and are comfortable creating repeatable comprehensible analysis
you're comfortable using sql and writing efficient code to handle large data set on a single machine you don't need to be comfortable writing mapreduces if you have those skill of course you're welcome to apply them here
you express yourself clearly and concisely in written and verbal discussion of complex problem
responsibilities
you'll conceive of and answer question about our product ecosystem using observational data
you'll design implement and launch experiment to test your hypothesis
you'll identify and implement metric that align with company goal
you'll contribute to our python codebase and perform analysis in r or another statistic tool of your choice
you'll advise coworkers on the mi use of statistic to understand data
example project
which market in our ecosystem are most healthy which are least healthy and how can we improve them
are service provider becoming more or le engaged with our company over time what's driving these change
which consumer are most delighted by their experience what drive the difference and how can we best improve the experience for our user
are some service provider consistently under- or over-charging for their service how doe that affect consumer behavior could we offer advice to help them improve their business
what drive difference in quote price across consumer request in different market how well can we predict the price a consumer will get
