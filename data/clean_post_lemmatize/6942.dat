senior-inventive scientist labs- big data research - 1615655
if this job is available in multiple location by applying to this position you may be considered for the additional location in your area
external and internal
in att labs' big data research organization we develop new method for analyzing massive data set to learn about our network and our customer and to improve service and operation we are a pioneer in big data technology developing novel methodology for statistical computing event prediction fraud detection visualization text mining data stream management data quality and anomaly detection and privacy preserving measure such a data anonymization
we are looking for strong analyst in a data science field with a passion for extracting insight from large data set we work on problem that cut across all aspect of att's business including network and service management marketing and customer care network design and optimization and new service creation many analyst work directly with business unit leader all have opportunity to invent novel publishable methodology that address real-world problem increasingly we contribute to multiple data science discipline through open source project led by att
we typically hire to fill two position
our phd level inventive scientists are technical leader in their field establishing external recognition while creating innovative business-impacting solution
data scientists will usually have a masters they are responsible for the entire data to solution pipeline they both support the inventive scientists and are responsible for their own project
location can be bedminster nj or new york ny
desired area of expertise
- spatiotemporal analysis of mobile data - the att network generates billion of record per day from handheld device each one providing a data point in time and space understanding the dynamic of this data through time series and spatial statistic help att better serve it customer improve it network and develop new product and service
- statistical computation - att is developing high-performance statistical model and algorithm mostly in r to leverage modern streaming and storage technology one example is the att collaborative coding project rcloud http rcloudsocial
- text mining - att is modeling free-form text from million of customer survey representative note and chat a one way to manage our business in real time new method are needed to keep up with the volume and complexity of this data
- data visualization - att creates algorithm system and technique for visualizing new data set at increasingly large scale att is especially interested in interactive visualization of very large geospatial and temporal data one example is our open source project nanocubes

- database management and data quality - att is building high-performance and low latency system to manage high velocity data stream these system are critical for accurate processing and analysis of data from the att mobile network analyzing the data to identify glitch and cleaning the data to minimize distortion while preserving maximal underlying variation are essential to ensure meaningful big data analytics
- predictive modeling we estimate model to predict customer behavior and sentiment service disruption and event impact models serve to both target and to gain insight into variable relationship our rich customer and network data allows analyst to positively affect business outcome and to pursue methodological research comparing machine learning algorithm for example
