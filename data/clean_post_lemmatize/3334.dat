principal scientist data science machine learning and system engineering
roche sequencing santa clara is developing nanopore technology to making genetic testing easy reliable and affordable we are creating a revolutionary low cost portable dna rna reader that can be used to improve the life of people in a wide variety of application including the timely screening of newborn for disease and the diagnosis of cancer and infectious disease
roche is looking for a motivated and team-oriented individual who is passionate about revolutionary sequencing technology as a data scientist algorithm engineer in our statistical modeling and analytics group you will drive critical component of our sequencing technology development your role will involve a wide variety of activity related to base calling algorithm engineering system simulation and analytics
in developing primary data analysis algorithm you will work with large experimental data set generated by our proprietary instrument a firm grasp of concept from probability theory signal processing electrical circuit analysis and machine learning will be essential for guiding algorithm development and system engineering we ultimately must turn noisy electrical signal into accurate dna sequence we also provide analysis tool and strategic guidance to other r d group working on system chemistry and hardware
an additional critical function in this role involves advancing a highly accurate system simulator and utilizing the resulting synthetic data a a supplementary training resource effectively guiding both simulation and analysis code development will require an ability to grasp the physical biological and electronic characteristic of our single molecule sequencing system development and support of the simulation requires a candidate that is self-motivated and able to work well in an agile software development environment previous experience with data pipeline will be very helpful a well
to this end you will be working directly with scientist from a variety of field including physic biochemistry electrical engineering and software engineering the successful candidate must be excited to learn new concept from these diverse area and apply them to an ambitious interdisciplinary project
responsibilities include
primary data analysis algorithm engineering
application of statistical model to characterize stochastic behavior at the single molecule level
enhancing a custom simulator platform and it associated data analysis pipeline
collaborating with scientist from a diverse set of field to advance system characterization statistical tool
must have scientific programming experience in python especially numpy panda scikitlearn matplotlib or the equivalent such a matlab and c c++ experience and willingness to learn python
must have a firm grasp of concept from probability theory signal processing
must have some experience with advanced statistical method clustering markov model neural network regression analysis principal component analysis
must be excited about expanding your current skill set if a new tool or methodology is needed you will have the flexibility to spend time learning about it and apply it to the project
a basic understanding of analog electronic circuit is a plus
experience with distributed computing or cloud implementation is a plus
previous exposure to field of bioinformatics natural language processing or similar is a plus
who you are
you're someone who want to influence your own development you're looking for a company where you have the opportunity to pursue your interest across function and geography where a job title is not considered the final definition of who you are but the starting point
phd or equivalent experience in computer science information theory physic electrical engineering applied math or statistic
demonstrated potential to lead complex long term project
