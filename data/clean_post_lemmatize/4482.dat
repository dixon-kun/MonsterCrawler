the dana-farber cancer institute seek a postdoctoral computational biologist and data scientist fellow under the van allen lab
and the center for cancer precision medicine http wwwdana-farberorg newsroom news-releases joint-center-for-cancer-precision-medicine-establishedaspx to work on the analysis of new datasets generated in the context of multiple clinically oriented cancer sequencing project in order help advance effort for precision cancer medicine
the qualified candidate will specifically focus on new algorithm for the clinical integration of whole transcriptome rna sequencing with existing exome genome dna sequencing to enable new discovery in patient under multiple context the candidate will also evaluate and integrate existing tool and database into high-throughput pipeline and facilitate the display and the distribution of processed data
these project include
prospective clinical sequencing to guide the care of cancer patient
studies of rna-based driver of cancer development and treatment response alternative splicing differential gene expression
studies of patient sample for tumor behavior and clinical outcome in context of immunotherapy
creation of new algorithm that effectively integrate rna sequencing data for clinical utility
these project are collaborative effort between the dana-farber cancer institute the broad institute and multiple other institution the goal of this initiative consist of analyzing sequencing data to determine the effect of genomic alteration and expression change on clinical behavior both retrospectively and prospectively these new data could help identify novel approach for personalized care in oncology in addition this data may provide support for new method in clinical decision-making biomarkers for rational drug development and new insight into tumor biology through innovative analysis
the person hired for this position will join the team in this effort and will participate in the design and implementation of algorithm to analyze the data and integrate with other data set including clinical outcome data this person will also help with the generation of tool needed for manipulating and preparing data for display transferring data to external collaborator and data repository and will also help maintain support and document shared tool code base and data set as the software infrastructure evolves this position is likely to present diverse and flexible opportunity - from deeper and more complex software design problem to becoming more involved in the bioinformatic and analytic aspect of predictive modeling
requirements a top-tier phd in bioinformatics genetics statistic mathematical physical or computer science or comparable research experience together with significant experience in computer programming and computational biological application a strong background in statistic and biology experience managing and curating large datasets and with machine learning technique desired excellent oral and written communication skill and the ability to perform both self-directed and guided research are required must demonstrate outstanding personal initiative and the ability to work effectively a part of a team ability to meet deadline and efficiently multitask is a must
