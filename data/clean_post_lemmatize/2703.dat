note just to be on safe side we want to clarify this is not a gis administrator or application developer role we need experience in using the gis systems to produce data solution
to boot we want our analyst to be natural change agent and passionate about change while empathetic to the client environment on how they leverage mature and incorporate data product service and new capability we want leader who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain subject matter expertise
our analyst will be on team that through facilitated analysis work shoulder-to-shoulder with them to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture then working very closely with their staff or system integrator to rapidly implementing that change or agile release furthermore we devise and craft strategy and communication solution to broadcast and brag about their change effort and result this is what we do we bring transformation to life
