data science incorporates technique across many discipline including mathematics statistic computer programming data engineering and etl software development and high performance computing with traditional business expertise with the goal of extracting meaning from data to optimize future business decision we are looking for individual that have experience specifically working with geospatial data individuals in this field should be an expert fluent in several of these discipline and sufficiently proficient in others to effectively design build and deliver end to end predictive analytics product to optimize future decision individual demonstrates sufficient analytic agility to quickly develop new skill across these discipline a those discipline evolve this role is responsible for leading the use of data to make decision this includes the development and management of new machine learning predictive modeling algorithm the codingdevelopment of tool that use machine learning predictive modeling to make business decision searching for and integrating new data both internal and external that improves our modeling and machine learning result and ultimately our decision and discovery of solution to business problem that can be solved through the use of machine learning predictive modeling
key responsibilities
uses best practice to develop statistical machine learning technique to build model on geospatial data that would handle a wide range of problem
develop customized spatial-related software solution involving the use of gis remote sensing numeric modeling business intelligence and mathematical optimization technique
in a team setting process manipulate and analyze geospatial data to extract knowledge or insight from large amount of vector and raster data
candidates should draw from the field of gis statistic machine learning and or predictive analytics analytic finding will be presented to internal customer in our connected car program
provide fused intelligence bridging geospatial and intelligence analysis and continuity between strategic operational and tactical level planning
utilize arcgis and other geospatial tool to assist in visualizing and analyzing geospatial data
work on data analysis and predictive modeling of geospatial and sensor data collected from the car and mobile phone gps accelerometer gyroscope etc
identify kpi's generated from geospatial data
manages data and data request to improve the accuracy of our data and decision made from data analysis
uses and learns a wide variety of tool and language to achieve result eg r python hadoop
identifies language and tool that can bring efficiency or needed technique to the team
works on data and business problem to drive improved business result through designing building and partnering to implement model
collaborates with the team in order to improve the effectiveness of business decision through the use of data and machine learning predictive modeling
communicates to team member leadership and stakeholder on finding to ensure model are well understood and incorporated into business process
works with leader to ensure the project will meet their need
the development and execution of a communication strategy with appropriate coaching that keep all relevant stakeholder informed and provides an opportunity to influence the direction of the work
reviews and evaluates on appropriateness of technique given current modeling practice to senior leadership
