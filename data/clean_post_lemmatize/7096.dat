we are looking for gis-specific data analyst data wrangler data scientist with excellent leadership technical and subject matter expertise quality our project solution need involvecomplex gis data repository complicated data source and workflow from feed sensor and other system there are many data lifecycle challenge including legacy migration metadata cleanup data model design need and massive geoprocessing requirement including image processing feature creation classification and derivative product generation we will look to introduce new web delivery solution to leverage this data help increating data and design bigdata prototype whether it be on cartodb geospatial d3 sankeys and various library feeding and harvesting rdf triplets into catalog or integrating into seo environment
our government and large commercial high-profile clientis a high-tech organization with program in science technology engineering and math they engage u to gis specialist that are passionate about transforming and making geospatial data usable for new service business model and to help economic development we are looking for people that believe geospatial data is the new gold the new platinum our specialist can do thing such a
develops geographic databases through use of gis gps and advanced technology for specialized purpose such a addressing utility mapping decision support converting paper product to seamless digital raster graphic and vectorizing feature while maintaining fgdc or iso-19115 compliant metadata
use strong expertise in various gis software primarily esri arcgis erdas geoserver a well a various geographic data format and standard data conversion and transformation method for geographic analysis
create map using large-format plotter report and presentation in support of various gis and technology project
develops and maintains link between various database and simple application and script and us existing script in python arcpy perl php xml parsing sql and multiple etl toolsets
creates new computer program or edits existing program in order to produce map and automate procedure
can rapidly troubleshoot gis systems problem with data processing delivery service generation and other data lifecycle issue in gis systems
note just to be on safe side we want to clarify this is not a gis administrator or application developer role we need experience in using the gis systems to produce data solution
to boot we want our analyst to be natural change agent and passionate about change while empathetic to the client environment on how they leverage mature and incorporate data product service and new capability we want leader who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain subject matter expertise
our analyst will be on team that through facilitated analysis work shoulder-to-shoulder with them to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture then working very closely with their staff or system integrator to rapidly implementing that change or agile release furthermore we devise and craft strategy and communication solution to broadcast and brag about their change effort and result this is what we do we bring transformation to life
at time you'll work directly with and get domain guidancefrom our architecture lead and report to our chief architect who have both been significant government change agent for multiple decadesboth enjoy mentoring collaboration and making appropriate decision and a quite familiar with these client strategy tactic protocol and solution that will be successful our client base enjoys the value these two bring and have made repeated request for support for them and their team over the year
