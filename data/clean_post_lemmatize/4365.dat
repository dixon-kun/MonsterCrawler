software engineer health usage and behavior data science team
boston ma
who we are
the health usage and behavior hub team at twitter work to measure and understand the satisfaction and motivation of our user from modeling individual user behavior to characterizing user population our work informs product and marketing strategy and help power core system at twitter to develop a deep understanding of our user we use statistical modeling machine learning data mining time series modeling and many other analytical technique we build prototype and we perform experiment all applied at the scale of twitter
what you'll do
you will work a an integral part of our data science team to develop and implement algorithm and system that can be applied at scale to twitter data examples of the kind of work you might do include developing and running time-series model on user log data large-scale graph and matrix factorization and building apis to interface with other part of the twitter stack to do all this you'll work with both engineer and data scientist on the team and elsewhere at twitter
who you are
you like building robust system that can handle large datasets and plug into production system but you're also excited about quickly prototyping and iterating new system to test out an idea for a model or algorithm if you're a system engineer excited about data science and machine learning or challenge like the netflix prize this could be the job for you you probably have
