role
data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at tesla we rely on data lot of it to improve autopilot to optimize hardware design to proactively detect fault and to optimize load on the electrical grid we collect data from each of ourcars supercharger and stationary battery and use it to make these fleet better and our customer safer
we're the small but fast-growing teamwhich owns the platform for fleet time-series data and the core analysis that need to be run on that data our stack is used internally by hundred of engineer and externally in the form of customer-facing data service
we're looking for a talented data scientist to join u a a foundational member of the team and to provide leadership in all area that relate to analysis and data service working directly with data engineer and the broader community of scientist and analyst you'll guide analysis define and operationalize data-services and help inform the future development of our data platform
you will support guide and lead the community and help tesla build a world-class data organization
responsibilities
many of your responsibility will be project-based depending on capability of the partner team the priority of their project and it computational requirement your responsibility will include in order of increasing involvement
providing peer review of analysis and supporting production implementation
guiding the definition of the problem and it solution with prototype where appropriate
identifying opportunity and driving their solution and implementation
you will also be responsible for identifying and providing tooling that can increase productivity of the fleet analytics community such asfeature extraction framework and model-predict-control workflow
requirements
5+ year experience in python
2+ year experience developing and operating high-uptime data service
5+ year experience in advanced numerical method
a strong predilection for good software and the process that make it
diverse experience modeling physical and behavioral system
proven success in the development and maintenance of customer-facing data service
smart but humble with a bias for action
plus
proficiency in java c++ c
experience with hadoop hbase spark hpc
experience manipulating 100's of terrabytes of data
basic sysadmin capability
experience with physics-based model andelectromechanical system
