monsanto's mission is centered on developingagricultural solution for a sustainable
future
that will include
a globalpopulation projected to eclipse 96 billion
by 2050 we
approach agricultureholistically looking
across a broad range of
solution
from
using biotechnologyand plant breeding
to produce
the best possible
seed
to
advanced predictiveand prescriptive analytics
designed to select the best possible
crop system forevery acre
to make
this
possible

from genome sequencing cropfield trial
manufacturing
supply chain and
everything
in
between
there isan enormous
need and potential
here to do something that
ha never been donebefore we
need
great
big data engineers to help
transform
these
complex scientificdatasets into
innovative
software
that is
deployed
across the
pipeline accelerating the pace
and quality of all

what you will
do
be a critical
senior
member of
a full-stack data engineering team
focused on
creating
distributed
analysis
capability
around
our
scientific
datasets
think
through
complex
scientific
problem and
work
to solve
them
by applying
cutting edge
data engineering
practice
collaborate
closely with
your
engineering team
colleague and
with
data scientist
across multiple
research
team
take pride in
software craftsmanship diving deep
into
code and constantly innovating
why you should
join u
work with other
top
level
talent
solving
a wide range of complex
and
unique
challenge
that
have
real world
impact
we value
the exploration
of all
relevant
technology stack
in order to find the best
fit for each
dataset
we
prioritize and pursue
opportunity to present
our
work
at
relevant
technical conference
