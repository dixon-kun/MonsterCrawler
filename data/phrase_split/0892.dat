automate and develop tooling
around
that
develop
one
off
experiment
for large
company
initiative and design
the
statistical analysis of the result
you should have
bayesian statistic probability- experience with
building
simple
probabilistic model
simulation and other
computational
technique to run
statistical analysis
for several mission-critical project
should
also be able to
package
them into
conceptual
feature
available through our
data
intelligence
service and internal

control
v variation factorial experiment design
multivariate
experiment
simple
random
sampling
v stratified etc
sql
experience
-

understanding of data structure and computational complexity
understanding of frequentist classic
statistic
you know how to sell
an
