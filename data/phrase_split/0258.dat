external
and internal
in
at t labs' big data
research
organization
we
develop new
method for analyzing massive data set to learn about
our
network and
our customer and
to improve
service and operation
we are a pioneer in big data technology
developing novel
methodology for
statistical
computing
event
prediction
fraud detection
visualization
text mining
data stream
management
data quality and anomaly detection and privacy preserving measure
such a
data anonymization
we are looking for
strong
analyst
in a
data science
field with a passion for extracting insight from
large data set
we
work on
problem
that cut across all aspect of
at t's business
including
network and service
management
marketing and customer
care
network
design and optimization and
new
service
creation
many
analyst
work directly with
business unit
leader
all
have
opportunity to invent novel publishable methodology
that address
real-world problem increasingly we
contribute to
multiple data science
discipline
through
open source
project led by
at t
we
typically
hire
to fill two
position
our
phd
level inventive scientists are
technical
leader in
their
field
establishing
external
recognition
while
creating
innovative business-impacting solution
data scientists
will usually have a master's
they are responsible for the entire data
to
solution
pipeline
they
both
support the inventive scientists and
are responsible for their own
project
location
can be bedminster nj or
new york nydesired area of expertise
- spatiotemporal analysis of mobile
data
-
the
at t
network generates billion of record
per day
from handheld device
each
one
providing a
data point
in
time and
space
understanding
the
dynamic
of this
data
through
time series and spatial statistic
help
at t
better
serve
it
customer
improve
it
network and develop new
product and services- statistical computation -
at t is
developing high-performance statistical model and algorithm mostly in r
to leverage
modern
streaming and storage technology
one
example is the
at t
collaborative
coding
project rcloud http rcloudsocial -
text mining
-
at t is
modeling free-form text
from
million of customer
survey representative note
and chat a one
way to manage
our
business
in real time
new
method
are
needed to keep up with the
volume and complexity of this data- data visualization
-
at t
creates
algorithm
system and technique
for visualizing new data set
at increasingly large scale
at t is
especially
interested in
interactive visualization
of
very large
geospatial and temporal data
one
example is
our
open source
project nanocubes http nanocubesnet -
database
management and data quality
-
at t is
building high-performance and low latency system to manage
high velocity data stream
these
system
are
critical
for
accurate
processing and analysis of data from the
at t
mobile
network
analyzing
the
data
to identify glitch and cleaning
the
data
to minimize distortion while preserving maximal underlying variation are essential to ensure
meaningful
big data analytics- predictive modeling
we
estimate
model to predict customer behavior and sentiment
service disruption and event
impact models serve
to both
target and
to gain insight into variable relationship
our rich
customer and network
data
allows
analyst to positively affect business outcome and
to pursue methodological research comparing machine learning algorithm
