data scientists are
the
creative
thought leader
responsible for
leveraging data
to create
automated
system
for the efficient
buying and selling
of online advertisement our
work
drive
algorithmic
product
innovation
across the company
data science
project underlie major
feature
for both
buyer and seller
on

and it
play a starring role in
finding and eliminating fraudulent
ad
traffic
from
our
platform
we
work closely with
engineer
product manager
operation and sometimes

novel
feature and system
we love
that

math
physic engineering computer science
statistic
operation research economics
political science and
a
spectrum of
credential
about half
have phds our culture
center
on
collaborating
continuously
learning and teaching and producing
effective
solution
whether
they
rely on
elegant
theory
or
industry
knowledge
we value
both
mathematical
rigor and empirical evidence and employ hypothesis-testing the
scientific
method
whenever possible
we're
also
friendly laid back
and
a little eccentric
about the job
use
machine learning technique
visualization
statistical analysis
etc
to gain insight into
various data set
some of
which
are readily available
and
some of
which
you
create and curate
yourself
using
technology such a hadoop hive spark
python scala
research
design simulate and or
prototype
new
algorithmic
product feature
based on
business need
spend
a significant
amount of
time
collaborating with
and providing
hands-on
mentorship to
team member
both
to build out
specific
project and
to continuously
teach and learn new technology and technique
apply
deep
creative rigorous thinking to solve
broad platform-wide technical and or
business problem
communicate finding and solution
clearly to
a variety of audience
eg
writing
clear
comprehensive spec for
engineer
or
explaining
algorithmic
concept to
product manager
actively seek out
a broad
understanding of the appnexus platform
product and value proposition and align
design
effort
with
that
context
work independently with minimal supervision
but
high
accountability
about
your
skill
advanced degree in statistic
pure
or
applied mathematics
operation research
machine learning
engineering or other
highly
quantitative field
graduate degree
and
2+
years' experience
preferred
or
bachelor's degree
with
5
+
years'
industry
work experience
doing
machine learning
or
statistical modeling
experience
doe not
have
to be
in
advertising
marketing
but
it
doe
need to be
from
an
industrial
setting
academic and research lab
experience
are not
considered a substitute
strong
coding
proficiency in
at least one
common
scripting
or compiled programming language
python java and or scala
a plus
proven
excellence
at
formulating
understanding and
solving complex
non-routine
problem
hands-on
attitude
toward
problem-solving
including
a willingness to dig into
terabyte of data
and quickly
construct
tool
or
model
aptitude for
diving into
learning
new
theory and
new technology
strong written and verbal communication skill
ability to work in a highly
interactive
collaborative
fluid environment
experience working with massive data set and
a
production environment
is preferred but not required
experience with
any
of the following
is a plus
generalized linear model
support vector machine
ensemble method
tree
based
learning
deep learning reinforcement learning
contextual bandit bayesian inference
clustering convex optimization
causal inference
experimental design
control
theory kernel smoothing generalized additive model
