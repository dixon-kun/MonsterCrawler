atmospheric and environmental
research aer ha an
opportunity for a satellite data assimilation scientist to support the noaa-nesdis activity
in cloud- rain- and ice- impacted radiance data assimilation in
operational
numerical weather prediction nwp model
current
approach discard satellite data
that are impacted by rain and ice and
to
a
certain
extent
cloud
this
screening prevents the current assimilation system
from
taking
advantage of the
information
content
in the satellite
measurement
in the region of high importance to forecast
to mitigate
this
problem
the joint
center of satellite data assimilation jcsda is accelerating the development of
method to assimilate cloud precipitation impacted microwave radiance the
work
facility
is located in the state-of-the-art noaa center for
weather and climate
prediction ncwcp building
in
college
park maryland
aer assimilation scientist
work in
diverse
area
including radiative transfer
sensor
simulation
characterization of atmospheric and surface
property
from space-based observation
cloud
analysis and more aer's assimilation work
assignment
are
interesting
challenging
varied and rewarding
we are seeking
self-motivated
candidate
with
ability to work in a team environment and
independently
this
project
requires
specialized experience in
physical science mathematics
and
computer science
in
at least
some of the following area
modern
data assimilation method
eg variational and kalman filtering physically-based remote sensing assimilation of satellite data
in nwp model
including
forward operator error
characterization and data quality control variational retrieval
method
experience with
at least one
satellite
remote sensing data set
is required
an
advanced degree in meteorology atmospheric science
applied mathematics or
a similar field
is required
because
software and tool
developed
at the jcsda are
primarily composed of modern fortran bash
script and idl proficiency in these
are
desired
aer offer a competitive wage and benefit package aer is an equal opportunity employer and
all qualified applicant will receive consideration for employment without regard to race color religion sex national origin disability status protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law
as a
federal contractor aer welcome

atmospheric and environmental
research aer help
business and government
better
anticipate and manage
climate
and weather-related risk
large
government agency
like noaa nasa and
the departments of defense and energy
rely on aer's scientist to help
solve
weather and climate
related
problem
of
vital
national importance
in
energy
environment
national security and climate
change
large
insurance
energy and investment
firm
count on aer to help them decrease weather-related loss and increase
profitability
by integrating
state-of-the-art
climate
science and
weather information
into
their
planning and decision
process
established in 1977 aer is headquartered in lexington massachusetts
