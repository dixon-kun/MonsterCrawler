what you'll be doing
mine
massive amount of data
and perform
large-scale data analysis to derive
useful
business
insight into
product
customer and market
behavior
understand
business problem
translate
them into
quantitative
model and choose the best
applicable
statistical and analytical
tool to drive
a
solution
develop
descriptive predictive and prescriptive model
using
deep learning
machine learning algorithm
identify
actionable insight suggest recommendation and influence the direction
by
effectively communicating result to
many
crucial
group
within the company
what we
need to see
phd in a quantitative discipline such a
machine learning ai
statistics applied mathematics operations research
computer science
etc
would
consider
