store
at
this
very
moment
this
data
is
used to generate
aggregated

about the team
our
engineering team
build
technology
that
identifies and analyzes
relevant
data
to match
buyer and seller
such
that
they
each
achieve their
business
initiative to do

real-time
solution for our
diverse
client base
consider
some of the
problem
you will
try to solve
conversion
attribution
in
online advertising
we have
to figure out
which
ad impression caused a
user to make a
purchase
we hunt for the needle in a
150 billion-row haystack and
we do
this
million of
time
every
hour
we
then
use
this
to infer why
the
conversion happened and how we can
change
our
real-time
buying
strategy to achieve
more of these
processing
data
quickly and reliably our team is
processing
more
and more
data
pushing
our
decision
engine to run
with a little
latency
a possible
we
get
a kick out of
making
thing
that
once took hour
only
take
minute
real-time
allocation
how much
should
an
advertiser
test
new
site versus focus
spend
on the
site
that are
already
known
to be
performant
how do
advertiser
allocate
spend
to
the
part of the
day
that are
most likely to
result in
user
action
our
algorithm
make
million of micro adjustment in real-time
to optimize our advertisers' allocation
over the internet
scale
we are always
seeking
new and
better
idea to help u
meet
our
challenge
