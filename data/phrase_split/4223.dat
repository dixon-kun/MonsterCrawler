analog devices is a
world
leader in the
measurement of real-world
signal
for
challenging
application and interpretation of these
measurement
which is
enabling the internet of things iot
one
focus
of our
iot
strategy
is condition-based monitoring
for
machine
health
application
the newly formed
condition monitoring
group
combine
sensor
precision
signal processing and other
hardware
with
data analytics
model
diagnostic
tool and
a cloud-based infrastructure

the
fully integrated end-2-end solution spanning
everything
from
hardware
platform
distributed firmware algorithm and
a cloud-based infrastructure
underlying
a successful
condition monitoring
solution
includes
knowing what
to listen
for
or
what
characteristic
to observe
how to interpret
these
finding
when
to put
this
knowledge
to use
and present
in a digestible form
how to iterate and improve the
learning
that
offer
greater value
