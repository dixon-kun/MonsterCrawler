enhance the quality of liveramp's identity
graph
types of
project
you'll work on
further develop
our

of paramount importance
is
understanding
identity
accuracy
ie correctness and reach
ie
completeness
how
many

this
conceptual
framework
in the development of data
refinement
strategy
that
enhance the accuracy of our
identity
graph
explore and quantify the
reach and accuracy
implication for
incorporating new
source of
identity
data into the
graph
