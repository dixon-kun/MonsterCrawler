nvidias invention of the gpu 1999 sparked the
growth of the
pc
gaming
market redefined modern
computer
graphic and revolutionized parallel computing
more
recently gpu deep learning ignited modern
ai
the next era of
computing
with the gpu acting a
the brain of
computer robot and self-driving car
that can perceive and understand the world
today
we are
increasingly
known a
