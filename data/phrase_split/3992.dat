genia's mission is
to make
genetic information universally available
our
proprietary
integrated circuit and nanotag chemistry
enable massively parallel single-molecule dna sequencing
this versatile nanopore-based platform
allows for
single molecule electrical
real-time
analysis
without the need for
complicated optic label or amplification by
developing
a true
integrated circuit on
standard
semiconductor technology genia's platform
enables the use of molecular diagnostics
in
everyday
clinical
care genia technologies
wa founded in march
of
2009
and
is headquartered in santa clara california genia wa acquired by
roche
in june
of
2014
the
data science
group
here is not
like those
at
other
company
we
generate and process massive amount of sequencing data
on a
system
designed
and
built in-house
from the ground up
as a
data scientist
at genia you will be
performing
analysis to drive
development of our sequencing technology
the successful candidate must be excited about
learning
new
concept
from
chemistry physic
algorithm
development and
electrical engineering and applying
them to
an interdisciplinary project
the majority of your
time
will be spent aggregating analyzing and summarizing the output of dna sequencing
experiment
you will also be responsible for updating maintaining and testing portion of our
automated
analysis pipeline
responsibilities include
using
command line
tool to perform data conversion and analysis
supporting
other
team member
in retrieving and archiving experimental
result
quickly
writing
script to automate
routine
analysis
task
creating
insightful
simple
graphic
to represent
complex
trend
who
you are
you're
someone who want to influence
your own
development
you're
looking for a company
where you have the opportunity to pursue your
interest
across
function and geography where
a job title
is not
considered
the final definition of
who
you are
but
the starting point
skills
must have
scientific
programming experience
matlab
r python
etc
familiarity with
numpy
and
the
python
scientific
stack
is a strong
plus
demonstrated ability to track and
work with 100s-1000s of
file and gb-tb of data
need to be comfortable working in a unix environment
basic understanding of analog electronic circuit is a plus
chemistry or biophysics background
is a plus
background
bs or ms in computer science physic electrical engineering or similar
experience working on a
long-term lab-based project
academic
experience acceptable
