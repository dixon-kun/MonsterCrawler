the
data scientist
family
is accountable for
using data
to make
decision
which includes
building
predictive model and developing
new
machine learning technique
that enable
our client to make
better
decision
to achieve
it
goal
the
data scientist
family
requires
analytic agility
the ability to quickly learn new
modeling
machine learning technique
programming language and
see
how
these
idea
can
integrate
to optimize the business
this role is responsible for
leading the use of data
to make
decision
this includes
the development and management
of new
machine learning
predictive modeling
algorithm
the
coding
development of
tool
that
use
machine learning
predictive modeling
to make
business decision
searching for
and integrating
new data
both
internal and external
that improves our
modeling and machine learning
result and ultimately
our
decision
and discovery
of
solution to
business problem
that can be solved through the use of machine learning
predictive modeling
this role will also
begin to manage
project
of medium
to
high
complexity
uses
best practice to develop
statistical
machine learning technique to build
model
on
telematics data
that would
handle
a wide range of
problem ranging from
probabilistic inference
on
phone
trajectory
data fusion
between
noisy
sensor and classification
of
driving
behavior
work on
data analysis and predictive modeling
of sensor data collected from the car and mobile phone gps accelerometer gyroscope etc
identify kpi's generated from
telematics
sensor data
manages
data
and data
request to improve the accuracy of our
data
and decision
made
from
data analysis
uses
and learns a wide variety of
tool and
language
to achieve
result
eg r python
hadoop
identifies
language and tool
that can
bring
efficiency
or
needed
technique to
the team
works on
data
and business problem
to drive improved
business
result
through
designing
building and partnering
to implement
model
collaborates
the
with
team
in order to improve the effectiveness of
business decision
through the use of data
and machine learning
predictive modeling
understands the business' problem
to identify
the optimal
modeling
approach
communicates to
team member
leadership and stakeholder
on
finding to ensure
model
are
well understood and incorporated into
business process
utilizes
effective
project
planning
technique to break down
moderately complex
project
into
task and ensure
deadline
are
kept
works with
leader to ensure the
project
will
meet
their
need
the development and execution of
a
communication
strategy
with
appropriate
coaching
that
keep
all
relevant
stakeholder
informed and provides
an
opportunity to influence the direction of the
work
