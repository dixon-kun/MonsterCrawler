        Who You'll Work With
        You'll work with our Pharmaceutical and Medical Products team in Waltham. Pharmaceutical and Medical Products is part of McKinsey Solutions and McKinsey's New Ventures.
        McKinsey's New Ventures in the pharmaceutical and medical device (PMP) industries anchor around a portfolio of advanced analytics offerings that blend objective third-party data, client context, and McKinsey intellectual property. The PMP Analytics team builds and operates tools that support senior executives in pharma and device manufacturers, for whom evidence-based decision-making and competitive intelligence are paramount. In close partnership with McKinsey's traditional client service teams (CSTs), the PMP Analytics organization works directly with clients across the core functions of Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D); Operations; Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR); Brand and Product Management; and Commercial Operations to build and scale analytical approaches to addressing their most persistent priorities. The offerings are informed both by McKinsey's longstanding client relationships and deep experience in the most successful PMP players, as well as by the data science, product development, and next-generation research methods of newer partners and senior leaders.
        New Ventures is a recently formed part of McKinsey focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for&#8212;and expands our investment in&#8212;our entrepreneurial culture.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
        McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures and offers practical tools that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements. We work closely with clients to embed our tools, analytics and expertise, and provide on-going support to help them build the capabilities they need to revolutionize how decisions are made.
        What You'll Do
        You will be deployed on client-facing engagements directly, leveraging Solution tools and expertise to identify insights and make recommendations.
        You will leverage proprietary and third-party tools (analytical, sectoral, or functional) to perform primary research and analytics to solve client needs and you'll identify and communicate insights and implications of your work to team leadership. You'll also develop business recommendations for client impact and you'll serve as the first-line problem solver to address any roadblocks or barriers to implementing analytics tools. Addtionally, you'll collaborate with McKinsey colleagues to understand client and industry context, and to tailor deliverables and implications of your work for the specific client setting. Furhtermore, you'll synthesize the core findings for client teams, and you'll coach clients through implementation.
        You will perform required analyses with highest rigor and follow-through and will have the opportunity learn any additional required capabilities relevant to the tools or subject matter at hand. You'll anticipate possible implications of the work and prepare relevant interpretation for impactful application to client context, and you'll focus on identifying new analyses or implementation strategies that could contribute to future iterations or extension of analytic tools.
        There is flexibility to hire at either the Analyst or Senior Analyst level depending on the qualifications of the candidate.
