        <p>
         President Richard Joel, who has ably served YU since 2003 is retiring and the Board of Trustees has selected Rabbi Dr. Ari Berman as YU’s fifth President. He will begin his tenure on July 1, 2017.

         Like most universities, YU was challenged by the recession of 2008.However, with thoughtful financial planning and new initiatives, the University is on target to eliminate its deficit by 2020.This is being accomplished by growing its student enrollment while enhancing and expanding its academic program offerings. YU has recently received a $15 millionnaming gift for its School of Graduate and Professional Studies which will be creating new master’s and associate’s degree programs that will prepare the next generation of students for relevant professions; a $10 million anonymous gift to launch programs in data science; and government funding to launch a technology accelerator as the basis for an Israeli-YU tech incubator.

        </p>
        <p>
         The University has an annual aggregate operating budget in excess of $200 million and an endowment in excess of $600 million. The advancement function is organized in a centralized university model---the central office is directly responsible for raising
         <em>
          annual
         </em>
         support for all schools and some schools (such as the Cardozo School of Law) have extra development support staffs reporting to the central office and to their respective deans.
        </p>
        <p>
         YU has an annual philanthropic goal of approximately $100 million in cash, pledge payments, and new pledges.

YU provides scholarship assistance to a large percentage of the undergraduate population, underscoring the requirement for annual support for scholarships and financial aid.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
         The VPIA will be expected to conceptualize, plan and execute a strategic and tactical program to aggressively seek and identify new funding sources for the University from both its traditional support from the Modern Orthodox community, as well as beyond and outside of that community.
