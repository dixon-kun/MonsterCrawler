Inventory Models - Carmax | Jobs.com
        Position Description
        Over twenty years ago, CarMax disrupted the automotive industry and to this day remains the undisputed market leader in a $500B industry. With best-in-class financial performance, customer satisfaction, and associate engagement, CarMax is well positioned for continued growth. With this growth, we strive to maintain our analytics-based competitive advantage through our algorithm driven pricing and inventory systems. To do so, we're currently looking for experienced analytical modelers and data scientists who are looking to apply their passion for data and digital technology to drive business-critical decisions.
        The primary responsibility for the pricing and inventory models team is to accurately value the unique characteristics of each individual car that we buy or sell, and also allocate those vehicles across our 150 stores. Last year alone, CarMax sold more than 1 million vehicles, appraised over 2 million vehicles, and had $100m in weekly auto auction spend - all while dealing with constantly changing consumer demand, wholesale auction supply, and other market conditions that are often regionally differentiated.
        To properly value and allocate these vehicles, our modeling experts must be able to apply statistical methods to develop predictive models that accurately and instantaneously calculate thousands of recommendations for our field associates daily. This requires the combination of a deep understanding of statistics/machine learning/other unique methodologies, the technical skills to apply that knowledge to develop and validate models, the creativity to be able to/the curiosity to want to apply it in a unique way, and the results focus and analytical ability to quickly diagnose and fix data integrity concerns as they arise.

        - Assessing the methodologies and processes used to develop and manage models

        &#8226; Our leaders are heavily invested in helping managers hone their technical, communication, leadership, and other skills
