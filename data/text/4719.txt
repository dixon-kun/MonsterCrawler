Senior Software Engineer - Applications and Integration - Genscape | Jobs.com
        Genscape's product offerings are focused on energy data which is captured via patented sensor technology so we are a true IoT-intensive organization with ongoing emphasis on analytics and SaaS solutions. Beyond our revolutionary sensor IP, Genscape's offerings are all software/data-based product. The essence of all our commercial products are the result of some of the most talented software engineers in the market. We continue to expand our software suite through organic net-net development as integration of acquired products, technologies &amp; data. Genscape is seeking a talented developer in the EAI/High-Performance Messaging space to join our team of software engineers! This Senior Architect/Developer will work on the next generation unified platform---we've released the first version and have received outstanding customer feedback and so we continue to evolve along the path of our technology strategy.
        This team member will work with the Lead/Members of the Data and Application Development Teams in planning, design, development, testing, and deployment of our current and next gen messaging and data movement platform. This individual will need to be a strong collaborator and communicator as they will work closely with the Product Developers to ensure that the engineers' activities are in line with the larger goals of Genscape's growth strategy. This individual will also work with the other members of the Platform team to establish and maintain design standards to ensure compatibility and consistency in all data environments.
        What data movement/messaging capabilities will this role focus on delivering? We are evolving to those messaging needs that our customers ask for: Tibco, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Event/Message Hubs, etc&#8230; We always want to maintain consistency of core DNA of content subscriptions and then publish as needed to our customers. Which data stores will be involved during the dev/architect process? Various given the change/evolution of technology, we are always exploring ways to embrace new solutions of all flavors---open, 3rd party and of course custom/derived solutions we organically create. This EAI engineer will be responsible for engagement with all Genscape Data platforms which currently includes Mongo DB, Hadoop, PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server as we migrate away from other more traditional relational data technologies. In addition, our technology team has architected our next gen platform to evolve from operating in a hybrid between hosted and cloud-based data PaaS. Our community and vendor relationships are exceptional so our engineers are often asked to provide guidance/feedback on platform designs as well as test/critique early-stage software from white-board to pre-alpha/beta.
        We enjoy engineers who love to innovate and are remarkably passionate about software development in all layers of the stack. Exceptional software developers are as much left- as they are right-brain thinkers given the nature of design and development. Passion for software, drive toward excellence of solution and outstanding team collaboration where ideas can be bounced around for feedback are all aspects of culture we embrace. If you see software as a direct reflection of what you love to do/build and if you say to yourself: "Imagine&#8230; I get PAID to do what I love---explore, innovate and develop excellent software with awesome technologies," then please do come talk to us for this role and/or other roles we have at Genscape.

        What you will do and learn:
        * Next Generation Application &amp; Messaging Platform: Next Gen Data Movement Capabilities covering all types of messaging, ETL/ELT, real-time event architecture solution design, and other related mid-tier services of various flavors.
        * Existing/Heritage: Design/Modify/Enhance logical models/patterns within existing messaging/event-based services and various other platform capabilities.
        * Maintain messaging infrastructure in a high speed message-based mission critical environment
        * Develop detailed design and architecture documents for Tibco/other messaging infrastructure environments
        * Optimizing and performance testing messaging (Tibco and other) implementations
        * Develop and maintain/modify Message Queues/Topics
        * Understand end-to-end message ecosystem and system dependencies
        * Drive end-to-end feeds-projects: Customized data feeds for customer-based distribution to their environments
        * Ability to apply messaging principles/architectures to various message platforms/environments: Tibco, Kafka, MQ, RabbitMQ, Event Hubs, etc&#8230;
        * Depending on experience the position has the opportunity to come into the organization at mid- or senior-level. The ability to operate as a full-stack engineer, architect and/or other areas of technical expertise will add to the breadth of ownership and seniority of the position.
        * There is flexibility in this role in definition, level and compensation all depending on full set of experience/background.
        Over your first few months in this position, you will know you're successful if:
        * You demonstrate a strong initiative to provide value in a highly collaborative team environment. We enjoy those who love technology and foster a culture where open discussions on latest/greatest development can be used in various innovative ways to solve real business problems.
        * You demonstrate knowledge and carefulness essential to develop and manage business-critical 24-hour operational systems. We live for uptime as our clients are financial traders and expect/demand the most mission critical systems that support real-time Wall Street traders.
        * Start with the basics of day-to-day operations before tackling organic development: In your first 30 Days you would know and understand the majority of the various message distribution / data movement / replication capabilities we use today and strategic analysis of future platform capabilities.
        * In your first 60 Days you would know and understand the majority of the diagnostic and critical characteristics of the system and be able to complete most if not all bug fixes/enhancements.
        This role might be for you if:
        * You have an undergrad, Master's or Ph.D. in computer-science and/or related field or equivalent experience. Some of our top engineers are from top 5 Comp-sci programs while others have deep experience in software dev after changing careers from various flavors of engineering, math, Physics, etc&#8230;
        * You have demonstrated deep experience and knowledge designing and developing sophisticated applications
        * You love data, mid-tier and cloud technologies: You may have always been focused on the data tier or you started in App-Dev and moved into Data-Movement/Data Distribution where you found your true passion, etc&#8230; Independent of how you got here---we require data tier excellence so please be objective.
        * You have demonstrated deep experience and knowledge in EAI/Custom Messaging development and/or application design operating under heavy load and ideally in a real-time environment.
        * You possess 9+ years of proven experience including a broad range of App-Dev/Data tier development and/or design roles.
        * You have at least a minimum 4 years of proven experience of messaging experience working with any of the preferred messaging technologies (Tibco, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Event Hubs, etc.).
        * You cannot be held back to only be 'a one-platform' professional: You may be a master of many and continue to embrace/grow your knowledge base given you recognize the many benefits of open standards and community-based development as well as exceptional 3rd party vendor solutions.
        * You have data modeling tools experience and have been through the 'data model journey' enough to know the pro's and con's of the many tools out there in the community.
        These soft skills are a MUST:
        * An ability to succeed in a dynamic/distributed team environment and be open to overtime when necessary
        * Strong verbal and written communication skills, team player with excellent interpersonal skills. We embrace SCRUM while distributing workloads across teams in a distributed development fashion. This results in a great opportunity to work with teams across the country/globe where some portion of the team is physically co-located while others attend stand-ups remotely via various collaboration technologies.
        * An ability to manage multiple priorities effectively with minimal supervision &#8211; we don't like to micromanage!
        * Self-driven: As mentioned, we don't enjoy a culture of micro-management. We do believe in SCRUM and bi-weekly sprints and that the energy to deliver comes from accountability and self-motivation. We don't believe in punching a clock and at the same time we do believe in delivery, commitment to team, commitment to individual and a career plan that rewards excellence and high standards/work ethic. We leave it up to you and offer very attractive incentives to reward such excellence and delivery throughput.
        It would be a huge bonus if you had the following experience!:
        * App Dev best practices and design skills. Architecture &amp; Design pattern best practices.
        * Master Data Management / Data Lifecycle Management
        * Enterprise software development experience and globally distributed team experience
        * Experience with ETL, Messaging/Pub-Sub system &amp; tools and Java/C#.
        * Understanding of MPP/Big Data concepts and/or experience.
        * Demonstrated interest in and enthusiasm for learning new data management technologies
        * Exposure to Cloud based PaaS and IaaS services including SQL Azure, AWS RDS, or SQL Server on cloud based VMs. We dual-home our cloud solutions so enjoy both Azure and AWS as well as some niche providers.
        Once you land this position, you'll get to enjoy:
        * A fun, fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where employees are viewed as the company's greatest asset and critical to our success.
        * Technology culture fostered and evolved by technologists and for technologists: Annual Tech Summit where we assemble the entire global technology team for a week to communicate our direction for the upcoming year, identifying new technologies, prioritizing products and how we evolve our process/team tools/etc&#8230;
        * Global Collaboration: Video conferencing as well as mobile camera bots where remote employees can explore/interact throughout our open work space and into (hopefully invited) team meetings and doing so across many cultures. We also support community gaming however we find that most folks enjoy coding more than they do gaming! Go figure.
        * Culture of 'Who we are as technologists': We are not the often over-used term of "IT" but rather we are Software Engineers forming the core of all product built and sold by Genscape. We are not a 'support function' in a retail, consumer or other hard-products business. Rather but rather are at the center of all that is created within Genscape which is software---not as a support function but developers are the core of all that is created at Genscape. We bring to life the product concepts, vision and details of world-class Energy product managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which is the perfect combination and one reason for build of quality product.
        * Being part of a team of extremely talented analysts, engineers, technologists, data scientists, user experience experts, QA practitioners and off-shore strategic development teams.
        * A company that offers a strong focus on work life balance and encouragement to make a big impact where you work. As previously mentioned, many of our talent pool are both left-and-right brain balanced and are as comfortable at a keyboard cranking code as they are composing music, rock-climbing, leading a band, restoring snow cats, welding artwork or many other interesting hobbies.
        * We also support working from home and flexible work hours: This goes to supporting the self-motivated team member where we want folks who enjoy going 'above-and-beyond' as a standard because they simply 'are that way'. The result is high throughput, consistent delivery and a happy team!
        * Excellent benefits and numerous perks including conferences, F2F training, online training and internal contests such as Technology Hackathons and Internal Innovation Competitions where we bring winning team concepts to life in product/technology.
        * We offer all of the above (and more) as we know you expect the most of us as a company and managers and we expect the most of you as an exceptional contributor! Apply if you want to join as an exceptional contributor to an awesome team---if you are looking for just another 'job in technology' and are at all a 'clock-puncher' then please pass on us.
