        Genscape's product offerings are focused on energy data which is captured via patented sensor technology so we are a true IoT-intensive organization with ongoing emphasis on analytics and SaaS solutions. Beyond our revolutionary sensor IP, Genscape's offerings are all software/data-based product. The essence of all our commercial products are the result of some of the most talented software engineers in the market. We continue to expand our software suite through organic net-net development as integration of acquired products, technologies &amp; data. Genscape is seeking a talented developer in the EAI/High-Performance Messaging space to join our team of software engineers! This Senior Architect/Developer will work on the next generation unified platform---we've released the first version and have received outstanding customer feedback and so we continue to evolve along the path of our technology strategy.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This team member will work with the Lead/Members of the Data and Application Development Teams in planning, design, development, testing, and deployment of our current and next gen messaging and data movement platform. This individual will need to be a strong collaborator and communicator as they will work closely with the Product Developers to ensure that the engineers' activities are in line with the larger goals of Genscape's growth strategy. This individual will also work with the other members of the Platform team to establish and maintain design standards to ensure compatibility and consistency in all data environments.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What data movement/messaging capabilities will this role focus on delivering? We are evolving to those messaging needs that our customers ask for: Tibco, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Event/Message Hubs, etc… We always want to maintain consistency of core DNA of content subscriptions and then publish as needed to our customers. Which data stores will be involved during the dev/architect process? Various given the change/evolution of technology, we are always exploring ways to embrace new solutions of all flavors---open, 3rd party and of course custom/derived solutions we organically create. This EAI engineer will be responsible for engagement with all Genscape Data platforms which currently includes Mongo DB, Hadoop, PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server as we migrate away from other more traditional relational data technologies. In addition, our technology team has architected our next gen platform to evolve from operating in a hybrid between hosted and cloud-based data PaaS. Our community and vendor relationships are exceptional so our engineers are often asked to provide guidance/feedback on platform designs as well as test/critique early-stage software from white-board to pre-alpha/beta.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We enjoy engineers who love to innovate and are remarkably passionate about software development in all layers of the stack. Exceptional software developers are as much left- as they are right-brain thinkers given the nature of design and development. Passion for software, drive toward excellence of solution and outstanding team collaboration where ideas can be bounced around for feedback are all aspects of culture we embrace. If you see software as a direct reflection of what you love to do/build and if you say to yourself: "Imagine… I get PAID to do what I love---explore, innovate and develop excellent software with awesome technologies," then please do come talk to us for this role and/or other roles we have at Genscape.
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once you land this position, you'll get to enjoy:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * A fun, fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where employees are viewed as the company's greatest asset and critical to our success.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Technology culture fostered and evolved by technologists and for technologists: Annual Tech Summit where we assemble the entire global technology team for a week to communicate our direction for the upcoming year, identifying new technologies, prioritizing products and how we evolve our process/team tools/etc…
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Global Collaboration: Video conferencing as well as mobile camera bots where remote employees can explore/interact throughout our open work space and into (hopefully invited) team meetings and doing so across many cultures. We also support community gaming however we find that most folks enjoy coding more than they do gaming! Go figure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Culture of 'Who we are as technologists': We are not the often over-used term of "IT" but rather we are Software Engineers forming the core of all product built and sold by Genscape. We are not a 'support function' in a retail, consumer or other hard-products business. Rather but rather are at the center of all that is created within Genscape which is software---not as a support function but developers are the core of all that is created at Genscape. We bring to life the product concepts, vision and details of world-class Energy product managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which is the perfect combination and one reason for build of quality product.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Being part of a team of extremely talented analysts, engineers, technologists, data scientists, user experience experts, QA practitioners and off-shore strategic development teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * A company that offers a strong focus on work life balance and encouragement to make a big impact where you work. As previously mentioned, many of our talent pool are both left-and-right brain balanced and are as comfortable at a keyboard cranking code as they are composing music, rock-climbing, leading a band, restoring snow cats, welding artwork or many other interesting hobbies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We also support working from home and flexible work hours: This goes to supporting the self-motivated team member where we want folks who enjoy going 'above-and-beyond' as a standard because they simply 'are that way'. The result is high throughput, consistent delivery and a happy team!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Excellent benefits and numerous perks including conferences, F2F training, online training and internal contests such as Technology Hackathons and Internal Innovation Competitions where we bring winning team concepts to life in product/technology.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We offer all of the above (and more) as we know you expect the most of us as a company and managers and we expect the most of you as an exceptional contributor! Apply if you want to join as an exceptional contributor to an awesome team---if you are looking for just another 'job in technology' and are at all a 'clock-puncher' then please pass on us.
