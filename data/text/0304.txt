        Edelman Intelligence is seeking a senior leader to coordinate, develop, and market its operations and services in the United States Region. An integrated research &amp; analytics consultancy, Edelman Intelligence is an autonomous and global business within Edelman.
        The US Region is the largest operation of Edelman Intelligence globally, both in terms of team size and revenue.
        The Deputy MD will report into the Global MD of Edelman Intelligence, and be his/her primary relay for all matters related to the US-wide strategic initiatives and business development. He/she will operate in close partnership with the Edelman US leadership team.
        The 4 core offices currently operating in the US are: NYC, Chicago, DC, and the West-Coast, and are each led by strong senior leaders who are closely connected to their respective Edelman partners (Regional Presidents). The role of the Deputy MD will be primarily to create, foster, and facilitate the synergies, collaboration, and the efficiency gains across the region so there we are operating with optimal consistency, quality, and scale across the US.
        Additionally, the Deputy MD will spear-head the effort to improve and enhance the partnership of EI with the senior leadership team from Edelman in the US. This includes the full spectrum of geographies, Sectors, Practices, and Crafts. As such, he/she will develop and market the offering and capabilities of Edelman Intelligence in full alignment with the current and potential needs from the Edelman client portfolio.
        The Deputy MD will also drive the US new business strategy nation-wide, and will seek to develop and grow the footprint of EI across the country by leading marquee client opportunities and service. This will include direct and indirect involvement through personal client relationship management as well as behind-the-scenes coordination and support for our offices to sell and drive new business successfully.
        Finally, the Deputy MD will work in partnership with HR, Finance and Operations, and Edelman Practices and Leadership to report, analyze, and formulate regular diagnoses on the financial, business, and people performance in the region. He/she will report all findings and analysis on a regular basis to the Global MD.
        Beyond the US responsibility, the Deputy MD will contribute to the development and implementation of the global vision and strategy of the company in direct partnership with the Global MD and our global team of experts. He/she will be expected to play a key role on our senior leadership team and support big-picture and strategic firm-wide initiatives.
        The successful candidate will have a track record of successfully managing a client service business and have an advanced knowledge and understanding of the latest and optimal research and analytics tools and methodologies. This includes, but is not limited to: (1) primary research (e.g. opinion research, consumer segmentations, reputation and brand measurement, message development and testing), (2) secondary research (e.g. media measurement, issue detection and monitoring, media analysis, benchmarking and whitespace analysis), and (3) digital analytics (e.g. Social listening, owned media analytics, content performance analytics, channel mix optimization, A/B testing, multi-channel engagement tracking, etc.). He/she will have a strong interest in earned-centric marketing and PR, and expertise of other categories within the marketing industry can also be viewed as additive to this foundational expertise, especially as it may relate to audience targeting, segmentation, and ROI and measurement of effectiveness/performance.
