        Business Builder is a startup in the heart of Central Square in Cambridge, MA, on a mission to help people thrive in work and life. We&#8217;re building a technology platform that is changing the way companies find, engage, and hire great talent.
We are a quickly growing team of sales pros, marketers, and entrepreneurs going after a huge market by creating a company built on flawless design, advanced data science and an incredible customer and talent experience. We believe that if we fundamentally re-engineered hiring it would look and feel completely different than it does today for both sides of the hiring equation. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here to do.
You should be excited about innovating in an archaic industry while greatly enjoying Business Builder hours, team lunches, and lots of hilarious interactions between team members.
This is a great opportunity to join our rapidly scaling sales team and position yourself for quick career growth. In this role, you'll play a vital part in the rapid expansion we have set in motion.
WHY THIS ROLE IS IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESS BUILDER:
Business Builder is growing at double-digit rates each month. The sales team is a huge part of the success we&#8217;ve built so far. To keep up with the constant stream of leads and opportunities coming in and to achieve our broader mission and vision, we&#8217;re adding more high-performance reps to the team. When you join this team you&#8217;ll have a meaningful impact on Business Builder&#8217;s success (and you&#8217;ll have a lot of fun doing it).
HERE'S WHY THIS IS A GREAT CAREER STEP FOR YOU:
Sales reps at Business Builder have huge career growth opportunities. We're at the cusp of significant team growth &#8211; doubling in the next few months and growing rapidly from there. By joining now, you have an opportunity to help set the tone early and participate in each stage of growth and development as we grow. You can hone and perfect your sales game and also move into team lead and sales manager roles.
You&#8217;ll be reporting to Connie Howard, our co-founder and COO, who has built and led sales teams from the ground up at massively successful startups like DoubleClick (acquired by Google for $3.1B) and Trulia (acquired by Zillow for $3.5B). Connie has hired, coached, and mentored over 1,000 people in her career and has helped many people become successful sales reps, managers, and leaders.
