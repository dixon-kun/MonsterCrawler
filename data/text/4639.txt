        Who You'll Work With
        You'll join one of our North American offices as a part of the Cloud Control Tower team, a solution encompassed within McKinsey Solutions, a part of New Ventures.
        Cloud Control Tower is a web-based application that enables business leaders to better manage their large capital projects and avoid cost and schedule overruns by improving data ingestion and data visualization.
        New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for &#8211;and expands our investment in &#8211;our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
        What You'll Do
        You will be involved in overseeing the technical architecture, product development and technical operations for the solution.
        You will drive the choice of technologies for the solution to scale balancing development speed with operational scale and maintenance overhead. When needed, you will roll up your sleeves and write code to make a quick bug fix, or write a proof of concept to evaluate a new technology component. You should be well versed with enterprise software architectures, cloud technologies, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery domains.
        You will work with internal McKinsey teams implementing the solution at a client, development teams to guide product development and our clients using the solution. You should have a real passion for software development. We expect that you will have contributed to open source projects, have participated in technical communities and interest groups, and perhaps have even spoken or published on your area of expertise.
        Despite having over 5 to 7 years of experience, a Technical Architect at McKinsey will still be an active learner - tinkering with new libraries and using unfamiliar technologies without a lot of supervision. Lastly, you should also have a strong understanding of Agile and other best-practice development patterns.
