        Fast Growth Tech is part of McKinsey Solutions and McKinsey New Ventures. Fast Growth Tech is creating and delivering impact for start-ups and their VC and PE Growth investors. We serve start-ups across a wide range of segments &#8211; everything from B2C to B2B to biotech &#8211; on topics from pricing and sales effectiveness to new market entry. We are looking for people who are passionate about helping start-ups succeed by both bringing the best of what McKinsey has to offer to make these companies successful, and building new innovative solutions.
        The Fast Growth Tech Solutions team is responsible for delivering innovative solutions that McKinsey can provide to start-up companies and investors leveraging technology, big data, and analytics. These solutions will be used to diagnose issues, identify solutions, deliver impactful results, and develop new insights and knowledge for startups and their investors.
        New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for &#8211; and expands our investment in &#8211; our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures and offers practical tools that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements.

        Additionally, you'll answer pressing questions by developing and testing hypotheses based on our data, and working closely with SMEs to identify, refine, and deliver relevant analyses. You'll meet client needs by performing additional analysis to support and respond to client asks, and preparing client-ready output for delivery and participate in client meetings. Furthermore, you'll have the opportunity to provide thought leadership on Analytics to subject matter experts and product managers, who will rely on your input for how to structure questions, refine data collection, determine the most interesting analyses, and deliver effective insights.
        You'll stay on the cutting edge of your field by keeping current with the latest analytical tools, data sources, and trends, and incorporating the most effective ones into our work. Your work will be interdisciplinary - you'll have the chance to work across a variety of topics, demonstrating an ability to apply your analytical capabilities to developing insights in new areas where you may not at first have expertise.
