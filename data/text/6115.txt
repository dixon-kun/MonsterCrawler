        Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 100 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and it's for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
        We're looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; you're passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren't afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
        That s where you come in.
        As an Analytics Manager, North America, you ll lead the strategic and tactical research and analytics efforts for the North American region. You ll be part of the Insights community at Riot &#8211; the group of researchers, analysts, data scientists and strategists responsible for solving problems and executing analyses that enable Rioters to make difficult decisions with confidence. You ll represent the voice of players by using top-notch analytic and research skills to translate data from a variety of sources into narratives that describe their experiences and suggest the right way forward. Through these analyses and your deep strategic engagement with the region, you ll collaborate with North America s leadership and ensure that we make good on our mission to become the most player-focused game company in the world.
        You ll share a campus with the Central office that serves the whole world, but as a Rioter for the North American region, you ll have a laser focus on leveling up the experience for players in Canada and the United States.
        You are:
        * Player-focused: you re a core gamer and a scientist, probably in that order, and you use your gaming experience to both help interpret the data you re seeing and generate empathy for the players involved. Bonus points for deep LoL engagement, given the community-oriented nature of this role.
        * Educated: you may have earned a degree in Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction, Economics, Business, or a related field, but if you gained your skills outside of academia, that s cool, too. Graduate degrees are preferred, but can be replaced by relevant work experience in consulting, consumer insights, or product strategy groups.
        * Strategic and business-savvy: you re well aware that there s no point to analyzing every aspect of a problem if the decision hinges on one critical insight; you re sharp about what makes a company like Riot tick and can find the critical path to how Riot can deliver meaningful experiences to players.
        * Technically adept: You bring a strong mix of qualitative and quantitative skills to the table. You re very comfortable with statistics, probability, and quantitative analysis methods that help you find insights that matter. You re experienced in market research or digital tracking methods. Additionally, you already know or are down to learn SQL, Python, or any other language that makes getting to the data more efficient.
        * Ready to lead mentor: You re ready to grow a small team over time, hiring new researchers and analysts to help grow the insights capabilities of North America. You may not have worked as a hiring manager before, but ideally you ve had experience managing and growing others.
        * Social: you can make friends anywhere you go, but that s the easy part &#8211; you re ready and able to build relationships and become a trusted advisor to decision-makers across Riot
        * Adaptable: you recognize that situations change, complications arise, and you re ok with that; you re adept at making plans and prioritizing under pressure, but coolly flexible and able to handle whatever comes your way
        * An equipped communicator: your strength in crafting accessible narratives around data means stakeholders can easily access your thinking and findings. You know how to communicate effectively regardless of the audience, and you re able to facilitate in-depth discussion to emerge with new ideas.
        You will:
        * Provide strategic insights to test teams assumptions and inform their actions
        * Construct, organize, and execute studies and inquiries designed to answer strategic and tactical questions of the teams in North America
        * Share your results with other Rioters in clear, illustrative presentations
        * Mentor other Rioters, growing their ability to be data-informed and helping them learn from your own experiences
        * Over time, build out a team of other researchers and analysts
        Don't forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of applications, but we'll notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take play seriously.
