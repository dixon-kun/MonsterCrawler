        Who You'll Work With

        McKinsey has selected City Voices as a priority solution for city clients worldwide. Still in its early stages, the team works in a startup-like environment where every idea is a possibility and the day-to-day work is on the frontier of innovation, both within and outside the firm. This tool consists of a deep and thorough analysis of the citizen's day-to-day life as well as critical once-in-a-life-time events. By looking at performance and perception metrics, the team is developing a platform to find exactly which pain points should be addressed in order to create more citizen-centric cities. The project is a major innovation on the relationship between cities and citizen interact, and will bring great improvements to public management.
        New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for &#8211;and expands our investment in &#8211;our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
