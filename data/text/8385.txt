        Regional Sales Manager &#8211; Austin, TX
        Tired of crowded markets, relentless price pressure, abandoned software, and unhappy customers? We were too. Let us introduce you to Clari.
        Now you can sell a product you'll use every day and be proud to represent. Clari's Predictive Sales Acceleration cloud is a modern product for the world's leading sales teams.

        This is an opportunity to sell a great product and financially crush it. But it is more than that. Clari is about to take off like a rocketship and we need all hands on deck. In this role you will help grow our ever-expanding customer roster and also collaborate on marketing initiatives, shape product prioritization, partner with customer success, interact daily with executive leadership, and help build the next great software company for the post-PC era.
        Seriously. Ten years from now everyone will be wondering who had this job. Well - you did.
        Individual Responsibilities

        Why Clari?
        On what planet does it make sense for 99&#162; software to look better and work smarter than $99,000 software? Sadly, that's typical. Inexpensive consumer software is beautiful, mobile, data-science enhanced, and a pleasure to use. Expensive enterprise software for large businesses is slow, unintuitive, and, behind the times in data science. People use business systems at work because they have to, but they get no joy out of it.
        At Clari, we're changing all that. Clari creates software business users love. Not just use. Love. Our software helps large businesses thrive, but whether on mobile or web, people are the center of our design.
        Creating user-centric business software is complex and difficult. Business software must scale to fit global companies and massive data, connect to many other systems, and be rock solid. And creating software people love means conforming to their needs, not forcing them to change. All of this requires new technology because putting a new user interface on an old architecture doesn't work. It takes a modern stack built from the ground up for mobile convenience, data-science insight, and cloud delivery.
        We believe the effort is worth it. It's worth it because we can make so many people's lives better. And it's worth it because having large companies as loyal customers is an ideal way to build the next great technology company. That ambition takes an extraordinary team.
        We'd like to give you some reasons why Clari may be the perfect next step for you.
        * Culture: personal growth, independence, and teamwork. Learn more on our website from our CEO.
        * Clear focus: our first customers are business-to-business sales teams. Sales is so critical to our customers' growth that these teams spend $9 billion per year for software
        * Executive team: a savvy, high-speed team on their third company with deep market experience.
        * Customers: leading companies who run their business on Clari.
        * Investors: top VCs Sequoia, Bain Capital, and Northgate led our $40 million in funding and make up our superb, supportive board.
        What's left to add? You.
        Creating a new generation of business software takes creativity, experience, and plain hard work. Our customers are happy, but &#8212; like us &#8212; they want more. We need hungry, world-class, team-oriented colleagues to reach our vision of business software users actually love. Not just use. Love.
        Clari is a fun, and fast-growing Silicon Valley innovator offering outstanding benefits and a collaborative environment.
        Let's talk about whether Clari is the next logical next step for you.
