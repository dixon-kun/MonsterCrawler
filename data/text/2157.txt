        Job Description
        Intel Sports is changing the game for a new generation of athletes and fans - you might've seen our work at some of the biggest NFL and NBA venues. We're about performance and innovation as a team - in the lab and on game day. We're a nimble, collaborative start up with the can't-miss backing of one of the world's largest technology companies on our team - Intel Corporation. With that starting lineup we push the limits of what's possible.
        Our team breaks the boundaries of sports, technology, and human perception. We see the limit and push past it.
        Will YOU join our team? Will YOU Push Tech to the Limits?
        Intel Sports is a brand new team and you have the opportunity to help shape the direction of the wider organization. As an early member of the budding Product team, you will also help shape how we build and develop the team and the practice of Product Management methods. We have engagements with the top professional teams and leagues. So even though you are part of a small team, expect to have BIG impact.
        We're looking for a Product Manager to help us build solutions powered by data that help teams win. With the insights that you deliver, teams will be able to execute better strategies in the heat of the moment with athletes performing at their peak.
        You'll leverage core analytics toolsets like machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence technologies like cognitive computing to generate these insights.

        Working with the engineering and program management leads to set strategy, define the product, and make the hard, high-judgment trade-offs between performance, features, and speed-to-market.
        Working with UX to ensure we build products that customers will love to use and with Product Marketing to ensure our positioning and competitive value are well articulated
        Developing complete product management analysis and artifacts, including market requirements, feature roadmap, and customer experience artifacts
        Guiding the product from the ideation phase, through conception, development and launch
        Collaborating with product groups inside and outside Intel to ensure we deliver the best experience possible to our customers
        Qualifications
        Minimum Qualifications:
        Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Economics, Data Science or Statistics
        3+ years of Product Management experience in cloud or mobile

        Preferred Qualifications:
        5+ years of Product Management experience
        MBA or Master's degree in Computer Science or equivalent
        Experience working with technologies around analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence
        Success delivering products/services in a startup, or other fast-paced, high-growth environment
        Passion for Sports and using data to improve human performance
