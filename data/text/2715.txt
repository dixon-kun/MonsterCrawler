We seek candidates who are passionate about teaching statistics to undergraduate and graduate students. Responsibilities include teaching three courses per semester, where successful candidates will: &#226;?&#162;make significant contributions to our instruction in statistics, which includes modern computationally-intensive and massive data methods, as well as data science and analytics more broadly; &#226;?&#162;coordinate introductory and service courses, engage in a variety of significantly growing statistics curricula across the university, and lead efforts in curriculum enhancements and innovative pedagogy; &#226;?&#162;continue to develop professional capabilities and participate in scholarly activities, including travel to and participation in professional conferences and societies; and, &#226;?&#162;participate in department, college, and university service and governance, as well as professional service. The faculty handbook (available at http://www.provost.vt.edu) provides a complete description of faculty responsibilities. These positions are part of a major emphasis on statistics, including computational modeling, data science and analytics, and empirical decision making at Virginia Tech. Successful applicants will have the opportunity to be key players in the creation of the university&#226;??s &#226;??Data Analytics and Decision Sciences&#226;?? destination area and to teach in the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics program (www.science.vt.edu/ais/cmda/) within the College of Science&#226;??s Academy of Integrated Science as well as in the School of Neuroscience (http://www.neuroscience.vt.edu/index.html).
