          **This is a project-based position that does not provide paid time off or benefits. The length of the assignment will be approximately three months (June &#8211; August, 2017).
          We&#8217;re seeking a Research Scientist in the area of Computer Vision, Video &amp; Image Analytics and Perceptive Systems who wants to work on the leading edge of automation in industries such as transportation, surveillance, public safety, and retail. We are looking for a skilled, dedicated teammate who believes their contribution can make the world more productive and a better place to live.
          Research, development and engineering performed by the team will include: understanding needs of the customers, overall video imaging and sensing system design, extraction of understanding from real-time video streams, performing designed experiments to optimize the systems, and delivery of robust prototypes leading to new product offerings. Example video imaging and sensing application areas are: (1) systems that aid intelligent transportation networks and self-optimize to enhance user experience (2) surveillance systems that monitor actions of persons and the state of objects and property for public safety and retail (3) systems that monitor and determine the state of production facilities and workflows enabling optimization and real-time control.
          The Research Scientist will contribute to a team that will use state of the art open source tools as we as invent new methods. They will design and prototype novel video analysis applications that intelligently extract relevant information and understanding from video data streams. They will apply machine learning techniques and other novel approaches to use the information as part of real-world applications in areas such as transportation, public safety and retail.
          They will also keep abreast of the latest developments in the field by continuous learning and proactively champion promising new methods relevant to the problems at hand. May proactively identify new areas of research and develop value-based proposals for investments in those areas.
          The Research Scientist will work with existing &#8220;intrapreneurship&#8221; business teams to develop and help commercialize highly user-centric, adaptive and robust systems.
          In addition to internal collaborations, the researcher will also collaborate with academic and research institutions across the country with projects at MS and PhD level. Journal and conference publications are also expected.
            Qualifications:
           Ph.D., MS, or BS in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics/statistics, imaging science, or other related areas
           The applicant should also have strong skills in software engineering with expertise in current programming (Matlab, C++) and analytics languages to generate deliverable modules and prototype demonstrations of their work
           Preference will be given to individuals with demonstrated research, engineering, or entrepreneurial experience related to developing video/image analytics technology with a focus on information and content identification and extraction
           Experience and knowledge in services domains such as business process outsourcing systems, transportation systems, healthcare systems and financial services is valued
           Desired interdisciplinary skills include big data analytics, modeling and simulation, systems design and experience with real world examples
           Applicants must have a solid background in mathematics, statistics and machine learning, with an emphasis in imaging / sensing systems, and computer vision
           The candidate must be an out-of-the-box problem solver, capable of proposing novel solutions to problems, performing experiments to show feasibility of their solutions and working to refine the solutions into a real-world context
           Strong analytical, written, and verbal communication skills
            Preferred:
           Experience in research, development and engineering
           A focus on developing algorithms that can be implemented with minimal/efficient computational resources
           Industrial experience
