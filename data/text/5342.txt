All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our customers and a successful, growing business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we&#8217;re looking for incredible people to contribute!
          Our team is made up of key engineers who built and scaled organizations like Google, Netflix, eBay, and LivingSocial. We build modern software with modern techniques like TDD, continuous delivery, DevOps, and service-oriented architecture. Cross functional partnership is deeply meaningful to us, and is how we&#8217;ve built up immense trust with the people running the business. &#160;We focus on high-value products that solve clearly identified problems, and design them in a sustainable way. &#160;In fact, some of our proudest moments come from solving business problems without writing a line of code.
          Product is a big aspect of what we do.&#160;As a Principal Engineer you will define the product roadmap and technical architecture for your team. Your drive to dig into complex technology and apply solutions to the business in clean, elegant, innovative ways makes you the trusted advisor to director-level business partners to understand needs and balance competing priorities.
          You won&#8217;t do this alone. &#160;Working &#160;with a team of engineers, you&#8217;ll help decide what to build and how to build it. &#160;You&#8217;ll not only utilize our current architecture and tools to help the team ship quality software quickly but you will also identify where we need to grow our architecture and technical expertise. &#160;You&#8217;ll help the team to understand the work in front of them, see the most valuable opportunities, and help drive them to the best results.

You aren&#8217;t afraid to dig deep and ask the tough questions of our customers, company and executive team.
            Leadership Style.
           Once you&#8217;ve got something, we don&#8217;t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action and will help members of the team at all levels be their best selves.
            Respect for the Craft.
