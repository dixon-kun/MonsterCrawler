        BuzzFeed News is seeking an ambitious and intrepid reporter to cover the FBI.
        The successful candidate will dive headfirst into the bureau, navigating its internal politics, getting scoops on its investigations, and understanding how and if the agency is adapting to the new political and digital landscape. The beat will focus on investigations with an international angle &#8212; including counterterror, cybercrime, money laundering, and so on, especially where these impact the US's influence around the world. This is not really a beat about topics such as immigration, drugs, and the process of day-to-day law enforcement.
        The successful candidate will be a news hound who is curious, aggressive, and eager to beat the competition for scoops. They will have a track record of exclusive reporting, and ideas on how to tell the big stories shaping the US. They will be eager to be a team player, pitching in reporting and working closely with other members of the Washington D.C bureau, the World team and the wider BuzzFeed News family. The successful candidate will have a deep understanding of the internet's role in finding and reporting issues.
        We offer a competitive salary, generous benefits, and a stock option program along with perks ranging from catered lunches to no work on your birthday.
        To apply, please include links to at least three stories (scoops or exclusives), as well as thoughts on areas of coverage you think a BuzzFeed News FBI reporter is uniquely positioned to take on. If you are applying but shifting beats (meaning, you are not currently an FBI reporter), please include in your letter a plan for sourcing up inside the bureau including, if applicable, how your current sources could give you entree to sources with the FBI.
        Responsibilities:
        * Break news
        * Deliver scoops
        * Write and produce stories that people will want to share
        * Write unique features that advance the conversation
        * Work with other members of the World team and broader BuzzFeed News team
        Requirements:
        * Proven ability to break news and develop sources
        * Great news judgment.
        * Strong writing skills with ability to turn around story copy quickly
        * At least three years' reporting experience
        * A genuine love for and excitement about the internet
        * Solid list of contacts and sources
        * Established social media presence
