        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
        What You'll Do
        You will oversee all activities related to the development, management, and delivery of the Solutions services and work closely with client service partners to advance the strategic aims of the Solution.
        You will have the opportunity to shape the business, including product and IP development, domain strategies, client development, financial management, team management, and operations management. You'll leverage your domain-specific expertise in working with clients and with colleagues, and you'll be the go-to person for all aspects of the domain, including developing new innovations in insights and technology. This is a pivotal role that requires a passion for business leadership, client development, an entrepreneurial approach, and delivering services with real client impact.
        It is essential that you quickly establish yourself as an integral member of the Solution Leadership Team and be a leader driving success of the domain as well as the entire Solution. You will be responsible for the full scope of activities related to building a business: strategy, go-to-market approach, client development, P&amp;L, operations, product and knowledge development, and team management.
        As Domain manager, you will be responsible for two essential functions. The first is Domain leadership. You will work to establish strategies for building and growing the domain and develop its value proposition. You will work with the Domain Sponsor Partner to maximize the domain's client impact and to be stewards of the domain. You'll develop new products, technology, and expertise for the domain while also managing its operations. You'll be responsible for the domain's P&amp;L, including developing a short- and longer-term strategic and financial plan. You'll manage the team, including domain- specific expertise within the team. You'll also identify delivery resources both within the domain and outside the domain to staff domain engagements.
        The second function is client development support. As Domain Manager you will support the proposal delivery process. You'll share expertise about the domain with clients and client service teams who are in discussions with clients. You'll develop the client pipeline and client service approach while fostering relationships with client service partners, and you will also radiate domain knowledge and expertise.
