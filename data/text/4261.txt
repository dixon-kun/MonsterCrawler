        Director of Merchandising Quality, Analytics &amp; Trust
        Wayfair is seeking a senior merchandising leader with a passion for driving change in complex organizations, who ideally enjoys retail both professionally and personally; and who understands the consumer experience of what it is to find just the right item. The right leader will be deeply analytical in training and outlook, highly attuned to technology-driven solutions &amp; process management, unafraid of ambiguity, and used to working on complex problems alongside very high caliber peers in a roll-up-your-sleeves environment.
        Merchandising at Wayfair is the team that creates our catalog of items, and makes it easy for our consumers to navigate and shop the full catalog -- however they want to. We gather data and images on an enormous catalog (&gt;7,000,000 items and growing daily) from many thousands of suppliers, across many countries and languages. We transform the data we receive into usable information in our systems so that consumers can find exactly the right item, can judge if it fits their needs &amp; aspirations, and so that consumers are shipped the right item. With such a vast catalog to create and maintain, quality of inputs can vary &#8211; and in our never ending quest to do the right thing for our consumers, we want to significantly raise the bar and consistently maintain a high level of quality.
        * Trust &amp; Quality
        * Define and drive a broad agenda of catalog quality including answering questions such as the following:
        * Do we have accurate data so our consumers find the item that they are looking for?
        * Do we provide data so that consumers are satisfied with what they receive vs what they saw on site &#8211; does the item match all their expectations?
        * Do all of our work processes result in a catalog that consumers agree is easy to shop? What is the trade-off of effort vs. impact and how can we refine to improve those trade-offs?
        * Create and drive a suite of KPIs and measures of quality that are widely consumed and meaningful
        * Create meaningful accountability around process optimization by developing a suite of quality metrics
        * Define and refine quality measures for work product resulting from various merchandising workflows; how do we measure how well teams and individuals are performing each day against our overall quality goals, and how do we trade off quality vs. throughput?
        * Present senior merchandising and category management with business trade-offs around merchandising choices and drive effective decision-making
        * Maintain and publish metrics, create share accountability around driving these metrics in areas where joint ownership means that quality suffers due to diffuse effort
        * Drive the "business model of quality" &#8211; create frameworks for assigning a value to quality, evaluating quality-oriented projects in terms of their potential business impact (eg, in terms of conversion, NPS, repeat likelihood)
        * Drive visibility of catalog quality and trade-offs for various projects
        * Own the voice of the customer in trust around the quality of our catalog (including informal and formal research); define an agenda for establishing what consumers love and don't love about our catalog, and the resulting improvement list
        * Define customer-facing articulation of product quality (a different sense of quality: how well-built and valuable are the items themselves) and work with merchandising and storefront product teams to define how we convey the quality of items, and how we differentiate between items of varying price/value tiers
        * Analytics
        * Own the analytic engine of merchandising: oversee a team of analysts who are working on ongoing and ad-hoc projects to establish ROI and effectiveness throughout the merchandising organization; these analysts will likely be both centralized and distributed/seconded to other teams
        * Create accountability for analytic projects; ensure resources don't get stuck in doing ongoing analysis where we can more rapidly move to business-impacting decisions
        * Raise the bar on the analytic work being done throughout the department to ensure we are generating assets than can be and are leveraged on an ongoing basis; build the capability of the organization through creating shared dashboards
        * Work with all other merchandising teams to define analytic agendas and priorities
        * Work closely with central data science, business intelligence, and analytics teams to ensure shared prioritization across merchandising is consistent and value-driving, ensure analytic teams have the support from merchandising they need to successfully provide value, and drive great quality work
        * Drive regular standardized reporting against merchandising performance on cost, throughput and other business-critical measurements
        Required Qualifications:
        * B.A. or B.S. degree
        * 8-12 years of relevant experience
        Preferred Qualifications:
        * MBA from a top tier school or similar education
        * Minimum of 4-5 years of experience working in a top tier consulting firm post graduate school
        * Track record of success in leading analytical teams and driving significant change on a number of projects
        * Analytical and process-oriented, comfortable working with large data sets and making data-driven decisions
        * Able to think both creatively and critically. Willing to think outside the box and challenge the status quo, while also fairly evaluating all possible solutions in making strategic decisions
        * Able to manage through ambiguous and subjective situations, including balancing operational efficiency and data analysis with high quality standards and a sense of what is "right" for the customer
        * Entrepreneurial with the ability to self-direct and drive multiple threads of analytical work to completion
        * Senior presence, able to clearly and consistently work side-by-side with colleagues at all levels/functions and synthesize multiple points of view into a coherent action plan
        * Superb communication skills, clear and concise in both written and verbal communication
        * Comfortable in a fast-paced, dynamic environment
        * Positive, energetic attitude, with the ability to inspire and motivate others
