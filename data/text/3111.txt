        1750 Tysons (12023), United States of America, McLean, Virginia
        Director, Digital Small Business Banking
        Capital One
        Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) is a new breed of financial services provider and Fortune 500 company (#127). With more than 65 million customer accounts, our company has grown explosively since our IPO in 1994 and emerged with the two things most growing companies can only dream to achieve: one of the Americas' largest consumer franchises with one of the most recognized brands (and wallet taglines!) in the United States. We're an acknowledged leader in innovation by Tech Crunch for our "surprisingly well designed" Apple Pay introduction and also in work-life balance and inclusion as one of FortuneMagazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For.
        Capital One, which is still led by our founding CEO, Richard Fairbank, has grown into a $40B+ public corporation, known for world-class analytics and strategy, fueled by a brave internal culture. We were born as the first company to develop and offer mass customization and personalization of credit card products, and we've been adding businesses and innovating relentlessly ever since. Here you'll find hackers, rockers, artists, entrepreneurs, and data scientists. As a team, we come to work every day looking to build digital experiences that are authentic &amp; bold. Today we are a high-tech company, a scientific laboratory, and a well-funded force focused on designing a better way for people to engage with their money, their bank, and their financial lives. It's audacious work at a massive scale and, hey, we think it's pretty rewarding.
        Small Business Banking
        We believe Small Businesses are the heart and soul of what drives our communities and economy forward with their passion and dedication to their work and customers. Beyond our customers, they are our family, friends and neighbors. We're hell-bent on reinventing the way Small Businesses successfully manage their money, engage with their bank, and build meaningful financial lives. It's audacious work at a massive scale.
        Our group is relatively new to Capital One so we don't shy away from challenging the status quo of process, policy, and the sacred cows inherent in a financial institution. Our inspiration is our small business customer &#8212; their ingenuity, scrappiness and relentless optimism for the future.
