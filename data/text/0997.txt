The role (Development &amp; Delivery Manager, VP) has end to end responsibility for defining and executing analytics focused programs for JPMC's Asset &amp; Wealth Management (AWM) and Corporate &amp; Investment Banking (CIB) businesses.

The role is a mix of strategy consulting (defining the &#8220;what&#8221;, problem solving, client interactions), program management (leading the &#8220;how&#8221;- the development and roll out of data/analytics driven solutions) and occasional hands on analytics as part of rapid prototyping. The role requires excellent strategic thinking to engage with C-level executives on defining the data and analytics roadmaps that drive business value and then running execution for the programs in close collaboration with Data Science, DevOps and Big Data Infrastructure - all while ensuring 100% alignment with the clients (executives of the JPMC business)&#13;

&#13;
A successful candidate will be able to:&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Clearly articulate ideas: how will a data, analytics and tools drive business value for specific AWM &amp; CIB businesses?&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Clearly define analytics (and work with data scientists to execute the analytics)&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Work across JPMIS and JPMC teams to implement analytics (requires understanding of big data infrastructure, data operations, data science, development operations &#8211; paired with strong program management experience)&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Work with the JPMC businesses to drive roll out (often by driving change in operational processes) and user adoption&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Drive decision making at senior JPMC level&#13;
&#13;

&#160;&#160;&#8226; MBA preferred not required&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Experience in product development is desirable.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Strong client engagement skills&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Strong written and oral presentation / communication skills &#8211; the ability to convey complex information simply and clearly to senior business leaders.&#13;
