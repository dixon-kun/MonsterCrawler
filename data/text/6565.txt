        * Collaboratively architect, design and develop message distribution system with the core platform architect and app dev team.
        * Provide SQL / database support to the application developers for ongoing sprint development cycles where we embrace SCRUM and supporting tools for Continuous Integration.
        * Manage the databases in development, QA and Production environments.
        * Monitor and manage the production data warehousing processes.
        * Monitor database backup process.
        Over your first few months in this position, you will know you're successful if:
        * You demonstrate a strong initiative to provide value in a highly collaborative team environment. We enjoy those who love technology and foster a culture where open discussions on latest/greatest development can be used in various innovative ways to solve real business problems.
        * You demonstrate knowledge and carefulness essential to develop and manage business-critical 24-hour operational systems. We live for uptime as our clients are financial traders and expect/demand the most mission critical systems that support real-time Wall Street traders.

        * A fun, fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where employees are viewed as the company's greatest asset and critical to our success.
        * Technology culture fostered and evolved by technologists and for technologists: Annual Tech Summit where we assemble the entire global technology team for a week to communicate our direction for the upcoming year, identifying new technologies, prioritizing products and how we evolve our process/team tools/etc&#8230;
        * Global Collaboration: Video conferencing as well as mobile camera bots where remote employees can explore/interact throughout our open work space and into (hopefully invited) team meetings and doing so across many cultures. We also support community gaming however we find that most folks enjoy coding more than they do gaming! Go figure.
        * Culture of 'Who we are as technologists': We are not the often over-used term of "IT" but rather we are Software Engineers forming the core of all product built and sold by Genscape. We are not a 'support function' in a retail, consumer or other hard-products business. Rather but rather are at the center of all that is created within Genscape which is software---not as a support function but developers are the core of all that is created at Genscape. We bring to life the product concepts, vision and details of world-class Energy product managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which is the perfect combination and one reason for build of quality product.
        * Being part of a team of extremely talented analysts, engineers, technologists, data scientists, user experience experts, QA practitioners and off-shore strategic development teams.
        * A company that offers a strong focus on work life balance and encouragement to make a big impact where you work. As previously mentioned, many of our talent pool are both left-and-right brain balanced and are as comfortable at a keyboard cranking code as they are composing music, rock-climbing, leading a band, restoring snow cats, welding artwork or many other interesting hobbies.
        * We also support working from home and flexible work hours: This goes to supporting the self-motivated team member where we want folks who enjoy going 'above-and-beyond' as a standard because they simply 'are that way'. The result is high throughput, consistent delivery and a happy team!
        * Excellent benefits and numerous perks including conferences, F2F training, online training and internal contests such as Technology Hackathons and Internal Innovation Competitions where we bring winning team concepts to life in product/technology.
        * We offer all of the above (and more) as we know you expect the most of us as a company and managers and we expect the most of you as an exceptional contributor! Apply if you want to join as an exceptional contributor to an awesome team---if you are looking for just another 'job in technology' and are at all a 'clock-puncher' then please pass on us.
