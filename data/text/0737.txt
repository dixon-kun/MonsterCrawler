         Yeshiva University (YU) is the nation&#8217;s premier Jewish, student-centered university devoted to teaching, learning, and research.The university&#8217;s mission is committed to Torah, rigorous secular curricula, intellectual exploration, and service to community to prepare each student for a personally and professionally successful and meaningful life.
         Last year, YU developed a four-year forward-looking strategic plan to be completed by 2020 to achieve global impact by supporting students with superior teaching and research. &#8220;Nowhere but Here,&#8221; the mission&#8217;s tagline, describes the uniqueness of YU. Nowhere but at YU can students be prepared to strengthen society through the continuous advancement of knowledge and values for the betterment of the Jewish people and humanity.
         Founded in 1886, YU is an independent university that ranks among the nation&#8217;s leading academic teaching and research institutions and reflects the time-honored tradition of
          Torah U&#8217;madda
         , the guiding vision that the best of the heritage of contemporary civilization is integrated with the ancient traditions of Jewish law and life.
         YU&#8217;s three undergraduate schools include Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, and Sy Syms School of Business and embody a dual curriculum under which approximately 3,000 students pursue a full program of liberal arts, the sciences, and business while taking a full core of Jewish studies. To date, these schools have produced over 22,000 alumni of record.
         At the graduate level, with 1,800 students and 26,000 alumni, the University's mission is embodied in the emphasis on the moral dimensions of the search for knowledge and the Jewish ethical values and principles that govern professional practitioners. YU&#8217;s graduate schools for which the institutional advancement (IA) department has oversight include:
          Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration,
           Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law,
           Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies,
           Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology,
           The Mordecai D. and Monique C. Katz School of Graduate and Professional Studies, and
           Wurzweiler School of Social Work
         Among YU&#8217;s affiliates over which IA has either some or no oversight are:
           Albert Einstein College of Medicine (YU is degree-granting institution),
           Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS),
           Yeshiva University High School for Girls in Queens,
           Yeshiva University High School for Boys in Washington Heights,
           The Caroline and Joseph Gruss Institute in Jerusalem, and
           Yeshiva University Museum in Chelsea
         YU alumni have gone on to become Nobel laureates, distinguished rabbinic leaders, world political leaders, business giants, and philanthropists, achieving immense success and making significant contributions to society and the Jewish community globally.
         YU employs over 750 faculty members. With seven students for every one instructional faculty member, Yeshiva University ranks among the best colleges when compared to the national average of 14 students for every faculty member.
         YU is a
          Forbes
         Top 50 college for return on investment and
          U.S. News &amp; World Report
         recently ranked the University #2 in the nation among colleges with the highest percentage of graduates pursuing advanced degrees within one year of graduation. Last year, acceptance rates to law, dental and medical schools were 100, 96 and 94 percent, respectively. YU is also ranked #49 by
          USN&amp;WR
         among Best Value Schools.

         OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
         President Richard Joel, who has ably served YU since 2003 is retiring and the Board of Trustees has selected Rabbi Dr. Ari Berman as YU&#8217;s fifth President. He will begin his tenure on July 1, 2017. Rabbi Berman graduated from four of YU schools with distinction, earning honors for his academic work in both secular and Jewish studies.Rabbi Berman is the current head of Hechal Shlomo---Jewish Heritage Center in Jerusalem and has a doctorate from Hebrew University.
         The Vice President of Institutional Advancement (VPIA) will be President-Elect Berman&#8217;s first appointment to his senior team and he is looking forward to engaging and working in partnership with a talented and dynamic fundraiser/manager who can design and implement a creative strategy to meet the current and future fundraising needs of the University.To accomplish this goal, Rabbi Berman will encourage the VPIA to collaborate with the entire YU community&#8212;the Board of Trustees, academic and administrative leadership, faculty, staff, students, alumni and current supporters.In addition, he will work with the VPIA to build and shape the IA program and the 40+ person IA team during a historic time of new leadership and transition for the University.
         Like most universities, YU was challenged by the recession of 2008.However, with thoughtful financial planning and new initiatives, the University is on target to eliminate its deficit by 2020.This is being accomplished by growing its student enrollment while enhancing and expanding its academic program offerings. YU has recently received a $15 millionnaming gift for its School of Graduate and Professional Studies which will be creating new master&#8217;s and associate&#8217;s degree programs that will prepare the next generation of students for relevant professions; a $10 million anonymous gift to launch programs in data science; and government funding to launch a technology accelerator as the basis for an Israeli-YU tech incubator.
         UNIVERSITY FUNDING
         The University has an annual aggregate operating budget in excess of $200 million and an endowment in excess of $600 million. The advancement function is organized in a centralized university model---the central office is directly responsible for raising
          annual
         support for all schools and some schools (such as the Cardozo School of Law) have extra development support staffs reporting to the central office and to their respective deans.
         YU has an annual philanthropic goal of approximately $100 million in cash, pledge payments, and new pledges. Of that amount, a key priority is to generate current use support in excess of $30 million in new cash gifts. YU provides scholarship assistance to a large percentage of the undergraduate population, underscoring the requirement for annual support for scholarships and financial aid.
         POSITION SUMMARY
         The VPIA, reporting to the President of the University, will work with President-Elect Berman, the Board of Trustees, faculty, staff, alumni, and other YU stakeholders to build upon the significant success of the university&#8217;s existing advancement program to ensure an innovative, comprehensive and sustainable program to increase philanthropic support for current and future institutional priorities.
         The VPIA will be expected to conceptualize, plan and execute a strategic and tactical program to aggressively seek and identify new funding sources for the University from both its traditional support from the Modern Orthodox community, as well as beyond and outside of that community. S/he will be expected to introduce new, innovative and emerging approaches to fundraising including but not limited to annual fund, e-philanthropy, and social media, alumni relations, major and planned gifts, capital campaigns, foundation and corporate gifts; and build and lead a program that is designed to tap the full resources of the institution to expand YU&#8217;s reach and to foster a robust and growing culture of philanthropy.
         The VPIA will also work closely with the Board of Trustees and its Institutional Advancement Committee to support and encourage each Board member&#8217;s personal philanthropy as well as their participation in identifying, cultivating and soliciting support from others.
         YU is committed to upgrading its fundraising software by the end of the year that will help enhance, streamline and automate relationship-building among all the University&#8217;s constituencies.
