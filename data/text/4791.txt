        Experienced Professional (EP) Recruiting represents a growing share of McKinsey's overall recruitment portfolio, and includes all non-campus hires across all levels and tenures of the Firm. As the EP team serves a wide variety of internal clients, there will be the opportunity to explore the growing and changing firm in this role.
        New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for &#8211;and expands our investment in &#8211;our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
