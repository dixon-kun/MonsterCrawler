        The Healthcare Analytics team uses healthcare data (payer / provider / 3rd party data) and analytics to answer some of the most pressing questions our healthcare clients have today such as "How do we manage cost of care while improving quality?", "How do we remain competitive in the evolving healthcare landscape?", "Who are the most vulnerable patients and what interventions can we design to better care for them?".
        Our capabilities are foundational to multiple high profile initiatives and have been core to the Healthcare practice in delivering organization wide transformation programs for payors (public and private) or providers. The MHA team has grown to 160+ colleagues globally over the last 4 years. It is a unique mix of Healthcare Experts, physicians, statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and more.
        New Ventures is a recently formed part of McKinsey focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for&#8212;and expands our investment in&#8212;our entrepreneurial culture.

We engage at a deep level across our clients' businesses, working in small teams to build the capabilities, systems, and processes needed to deliver bottom-line results and then ensure those results are sustained. Our work is about problem solving, coaching, and delivering lasting outcomes.
