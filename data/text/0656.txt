As program manager you will manage a large portfolio of current students and be ultimately responsible for them successfully completing of the course and landing their first job. To achieve this you'll be in regular contact with students over email, chat, and video calls to coach them through this demanding program, proactively remove obstacles to student success, and respond to any issues that come up.

In addition to your work directly with students you'll be expected to conceive and pilot new features for the student experience, contribute to curriculum improvements, and manage relationships with the data scientists who mentor your students. You'll need a lot of energy and positivity to work with a wide variety of student personalities through both the amazing times and the difficult ones.
