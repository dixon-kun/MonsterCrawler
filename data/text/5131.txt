        Who You'll Work With
        You'll work with our New Ventures team in Atlanta, Chicago or Stamford. New Ventures is a recently formed part of McKinsey focused on fostering innovations driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile, social and other technologies and integrating them into our client work. It is a foundation for&#8212;and expands our investment in&#8212;our entrepreneurial culture.
        As one of the fastest-growing parts of our firm, New Ventures has more than 1,000 dedicated professionals (including more than 800 analysts and data scientists) and we're hiring more mathematicians, data scientists, designers, software engineers, product managers, client development managers and general managers.
        McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures and offers practical tools that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements. We work closely with clients to embed our tools, analytics and expertise, and provide on-going support to help them build the capabilities they need to revolutionize how decisions are made.
        What You'll Do
        As described in more detail below, you will work closely with leaders in Learning and New Ventures to develop the vision, strategy, framework, and roadmap for capability building in New Ventures, and manage the portfolio of offerings that results from it. You will be responsible for defining, co-creating, and managing integrated learning and development journeys for New Ventures colleagues that meet their specific needs and support their unique professional aspirations. Effective stakeholder management is key to this role, given the significant breadth of the New Ventures team.
        This role will focus on monitoring execution of the strategy and operational effectiveness of program portfolio, adjusting course as necessary. This includes ensuring near-term implementation of quick wins: e.g., in onboarding (which is a critical immediate need for New Ventures given its 40% annual growth rate), and sharing existing best practices across the various solutions within New Ventures.
        You will maintain an understanding of New Ventures health and skill development needs, as well as implications of critical strategic Firm thrusts to the portfolio as well as support and foster the creation of truly blended capability building solutions including interactive instructor-led classroom learning, digital learning solutions (including web-based and virtual classroom training, video, SPOCS, online performance support) and workplace-based learning and apprenticeship.
        Your success will also depend on a high level of collaboration with Portfolio Managers/Specialists and Learning Solution Architects in the Design and Development Center of Excellence, bringing in expertise and best pedagogy from inside and outside the Firm, as well as crafting and managing change management required for effective implementation. Also key will be your ability to collaborate with other learning teams, leading cross-cutting initiatives to enhance and streamline learning across cells
