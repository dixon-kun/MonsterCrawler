         We are looking for an experienced digital fixed operations expert from the auto dealership world to support our dealership customers in the area of Digital Strategy for parts and accessories. You will work hand-in-hand with our key dealers to develop objectives and goals for their websites with us, and a strategy to meet them. In this role, you will be the steward of our relationships with our most important dealerships. These dealers will rely on you to answer their advanced questions about profitability, strategy and performance - and trust you to proactively reach out to help them recognize and respond to opportunity.
         You will have access to an overwhelming amount of numbers, data and science. Your job is to understand and distill the numbers, data and science into something simple that works for each dealer, and to clearly and transparently explain what we&#8217;re doing for them. The relationship and trust you build with each dealer is what will keep them engaged and growing.
         This is not a support or technical sales role. Rather, you will relate to our existing, key dealers in a second tier consulting and strategy capacity, by phone out of our Atlanta office. There may be some travel/field time, but that is not the focus. You must have previous dealership experience - working in or with franchised car dealers - or overwhelmingly demonstrate to us in your cover letter that you can quickly come up to speed with industry language and nuances of the dealership environment. You will be working with dealers at all levels of engagement and experience, and helping them understand how our services and tools can be put to work to meet their objectives - familiarity with parts, ecommerce, technology, digital marketing and our abilities in the space will be critical.
         You will work hand in hand with our analysis and marketing teams, as well as a deep bench of internal tools and reports in support of helping dealers understand the larger online parts market and developing a strategy which defines their place and objectives within it.
          Responsibilities:
          Hold weekly group performance and best practices calls for our dealers.
          Proactively call dealers and engage them in a discussion about strategy and opportunity.
          Respond to dealer calls about strategy.
          Ensure our dealers take maximum advantage of their OEM&#8217;s support, and our services.
          Find opportunity and revenue for dealers and for SimplePart.
          Build relationships with our key dealers, and a cadence for regular status calls
         This is a fun, fast-paced, close-knit environment with plenty of room to grow and be creative. We are an established, solidly profitable company with a start-up working environment and a brilliant team. We offer full-time W2 positions with company-paid health/dental/vision/life benefits, FSA, matching 401(k), paid vacation, dog-friendly office, relaxed dress code, eclectic company culture, and a great office location in Downtown Atlanta.
