        Job Description:
        The Augsburg College Computer Science Department invites applications for full-time tenure-track and non-tenure-track positions beginning August 15, 2017. Computer Science at Augsburg is a growing and dynamic department in an institution committed to liberal education, experiential learning, undergraduate research, and equity and inclusion. Augsburg College is a college of the city, providing an education based on critical analysis, leadership and responsible citizenship of a very diverse student body. We base our Computer Science on the standards of the Association of Computing Machinery.
        We seek candidates who can contribute to a department poised for innovation, growth, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The Computer Science Department thus seeks candidates with a broad range of academic expertise, commitment to undergraduate education, and special interest in:
        * Data Science and Analytics
        * Computer applications to Business
        * Complex Software such as compilers
        * Computer Languages
        Selected candidates will work in a growing department in the new Hagfors Center for Science, Business, and Religion, to be completed January, 2018. We have designed a Computer Science office space with offices surrounding a common area where students study and learn. Faculty members will have intimate contact with hundreds of students in all courses from an Introduction to Computer Science (CS 0) to Languages and Compiler Development.
        Responsibilities for the tenure-track positions include the ability to teach a full range of undergraduate Computer Science courses, student advising, and service to the department and the College through committee work. Faculty will be expected to continue their scholarly work and involve undergraduates in their work.
        Responsibilities for non-tenure track positions include the ability to teach a full range of undergraduate Computer Science courses, student advising, and service to the department and the College through committee work. Non-tenure track faculty members are not evaluated based on their active scholarly work.
        Requirements:
        Minimum requirements for Tenure Track positions include a PhD in a relevant field, and teaching experience; those for Non-Tenure Track positions include a Master's in a relevant field and teaching experience. We seek committed and creative teachers who will be responsible for teaching a diverse student body. Candidates should be open to extensive involvement in student activities.
        Additional Information:
        Among the distinctive features of the College are its deep dedication to civic and community engagement, and a strong belief in the integration of liberal arts and professional studies across all programs. The College's commitment to the local neighborhood and the world is enhanced through the work of four signature centers: the Christensen Center for Vocation, the Center for Global Education, the Sabo Center for Citizenship and Learning, and the Strommen Center for Meaningful Work. At both undergraduate and graduate levels, students actively engage in international travel and intercultural experiences that broaden their view of the world and deepen their engagement in it.
