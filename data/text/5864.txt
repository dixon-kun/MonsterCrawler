        Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 100 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and it's for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
        We're looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; you're passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, aren't afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
        That's where you come in.
        As a Researcher, you'll join the Insights discipline &#8211; the group of researchers, analysts, data scientists, and strategists responsible for solving problems and executing analyses that enable Rioters to make difficult decisions with confidence. You'll be part of a product team and work closely with designers and producers to create and conduct studies that'll inform the features, systems, and experiences of our games. Your applied or experimental research background coupled with your deep understanding of data will ensure that you're an effective advocate for players and can provide strategic guidance about their wants, needs, and behaviors.
        This posting covers a range of levels, including senior and principal researchers. In general, we re looking for folks who have some experience with research under their belts. At minimum, we d want you to have an advanced degree involving research or over a year of professional experience in a research role. Having more experiences and skills to draw on is a plus, especially if you have both qualitative and quantitative research experience.
        YOU ARE:
        * Educated: you may have earned a degree in Psychology, Anthropology, Human-Computer Interaction, or a related field, but if you gained your skills outside of academia, that's cool, too. You might be a market researcher, a cognitive psychologist, a user experience researcher&#8230; many disciplines fit into our definition of research!
        * Experienced: you've accrued years of experience in applied or experimental research, know your way around direct user testing and survey studies, and are comfortable with user or market research methodologies (bonus points for both)
        * A planning pro: you know when to construct a hyper-detailed experiment and when to prioritize efficiency for an urgent need, all while keeping partners and stakeholders informed throughout the process
        * Strategic and business-savvy: you're well aware that there's no point in analyzing every aspect of a problem if the decision hinges on one critical insight; you're sharp about what makes a company like Riot tick and can find the critical path to how Riot can deliver meaningful experiences to players.
        * Data-informed: you creatively construct ways to scientifically measure any issue through targeted research; you meticulously analyze results, converting them into actionable insights
        * An equipped communicator: you're comfortable using Excel, Powerpoint, and/or Tableau; you're capable of translating raw data into reports and presentations that are clear and concise, and delivering them to a variety of audiences
        * A gaming empath: a player yourself, you're well-versed in games and jump at the chance to immerse yourself in the culture, learning the wants and needs of gamers all over the globe
        YOU WILL:
        * Provide strategic insights to test teams' assumptions and inform their actions
        * Construct, organize, and execute studies and surveys designed to answer business, development, and usability questions
        * Design and moderate labs, guiding participants through a set of tasks and prompting them for genuine, actionable feedback
        * Share your results with other Rioters in clear, illustrative presentations
        * Mentor other researchers, helping them learn from your own experiences
        Don't forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of applications, but we'll notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take play seriously.
