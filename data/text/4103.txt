                   Or
               About the Team&#13;
The Growth team at Stitch Fix is responsible for driving new client acquisition. At its core, Stitch Fix is a personalization service, and our team leverages data to bring that same level of personalization to our marketing -- thus driving more effective and efficient acquisition. Partnering closely with the broader marketing team on conversion and retention, as well as our data science, creative, and engineering teams, we deploy a significant budget against a wide array of marketing channels, while experimenting across new channels and within existing ones.&#13;
&#13;
About the Role&#13;
As the Growth Manager for our mobile app(s) and referral program, you will own two critical avenues of growth. On referrals, you&#8217;ll assume ownership over one of our most meaningful growth channels to-date and take it to the next level -- across web and app. On mobile, you&#8217;ll build a new muscle in the company, as we have not yet placed any concerted acquisition efforts around our iOS app. You&#8217;ll partner closely with our engineering and conversion teams to find efficient ways to drive new clients via the app, at scale. You&#8217;ll wear both marketing and product hats, realizing that the best growth opportunities for these channels lie at the intersection.&#13;
&#13;
You&#8217;re excited about this opportunity because you will&#8230;&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Own the strategy, vision, and execution of our referral program, across properties. Our service originally grew through word of mouth, and our referral program is a tool to amplify that WOM.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Build a new organizational muscle around mobile app acquisition. We have only scratched the surface of acquiring new clients via our app, and are ready to step on the gas.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Support a high-velocity and high-integrity testing environment, from optimizations to bold experiments. Partner with analytics on test design, instrumentation, measurement, and dashboarding.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Coordinate tightly with other channel managers, sharing learnings regularly and applying within your channels.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Be a talent magnet; build a team of associates and further establish Stitch Fix&#8217;s reputation as a world-class personalization company.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Drive vision for our mobile growth function and the broader acquisition team as we scale.&#13;
&#13;
We&#8217;re excited about you because&#8230;&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You have a BS degree, excellent analytical skills, and 5+ years of experience in growth/performance marketing, at-scale.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You live and breathe mobile growth, stay ahead of cutting-edge trends, and can establish yourself as the in-house subject matter expert.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You focus on top-of-funnel but understand implications through the entire funnel. You&#8217;ll closely inform our product development and conversion efforts.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You are knowledgeable around attribution and marketing mix models, viewing channel effectiveness through a holistic lens.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You have experience buying install ads in mobile-focused channels, and are proficient tools to support attribution (e.g. AppsFlyer) and deeplinking (e.g. Branch).&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You have overseen the development of a consumer-facing referral program (or invite flow) across web and mobile properties.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You&#8217;ve built and managed high-functioning teams in the past, and have a network of stellar performance/growth marketers to tap into as we build the team.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You understand the nuances and complexities of data but act as a simplifier, realizing that data and insights are only powerful if they drive action.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You balance a mindset of optimization vs bold, creative, step-function changes.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You thrive in high-volume, fast-paced and feedback driven environments.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; People describe you as exceptionally organized and detail-oriented.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Cross-functional communication comes naturally to you in solving problems and addressing roadblocks -- you can speak the language of both marketing and product.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; You&#8217;re highly self-motivated, have a stellar work ethic and you&#8217;re looking for the right company to support your growth.&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Above all else you are bright, kind and goal-oriented.&#13;
&#13;
You&#8217;ll love working at Stitch Fix because we&#8230;&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Are a successful, fast-growing company with a start-up work vibe&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Are a technologically and data-driven business&#13;

&#160;&#160;&#8226; Are at the forefront of tech and fashion, redefining shopping for the next generation&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Are passionate about our clients and live/breathe the client experience&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Get to be creative on a daily basis&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Are a smart and experienced leadership team that wants to do it right &amp; is open to new ideas&#13;
&#160;&#160;&#8226; Believe in autonomy &amp; taking initiative&#13;
