        POSITION SUMMARY:
        Individuals in the Data scientist role provide overall direction, guidance, definition and facilitation for the development of an architecture (current and future state) required to meet business strategies and goals. Responsibilities include advocacy and support of the enterprise's IT strategies, identification and analysis of enterprise business drivers to derive useful business context, analysis of the current IT environment to detect critical deficiencies and recommend solutions for improvement, and the development of strategies aligning IT to business.
        Data scientists interface across all business areas, acting as visionaries to proactively assist in defining the direction for future projects. They conceive strategies, solutions, build consensus, and sell/execute solutions. They are involved in all aspects of the project life cycle, from the initial kickoff through the requirements analysis, design and implementation. Additional responsibilities may include the establishment of the overall architectural viewpoints and the establishment and oversight of organization standards and policies. Architects identify major system interfaces, business capabilities needs, and existing architecture weaknesses and opportunities for systems.
        Serving in this role requires an individual to be a self-starter, work independently, and as a team member. They have to have strong communication skills in interfacing with business partners and the IT community. Architects are also responsible for educating and guiding others on architectural standards, principles, methodology and trends. They must have significant business knowledge and have expertise within one or more areas of information, solution, and/or technical architecture in which they concentrate. Architects are expected to mentor and coach less experienced staff and provide knowledge transfer across the organization.
        The Data scientist provides guidance, road maps, principles, standards and best practices. They must be focused on enabling business and IT leaders to make investment decisions that balance and prioritize current operational demands, disruptions, and opportunities with the longer-term strategic vision of the organization. This role will work on multiple projects as a project leader or internal consultant, and be viewed as an expert and provides knowledge and counsel to others. They will also work on highly complex projects that require in-depth knowledge of one or more specialized architecture areas such as network, security, applications, data, systems and Internet and business segments.

        * Aligns architectural requirements with IT strategy.
        * Asses near-term needs to establish business priorities.
        * Consults with project teams to ensure compatibility with existing solutions, infrastructure and services.
        * Identifies opportunities for reuse.
        * Supports the development of software and data delivery platforms with reusable components that can be orchestrated together into different methods for different business.
        * Coordinates architecture implementation and modification activities.
        * Assists in post-implementation continuous-improvement efforts to enhance performance and provide increased functionality.
        * Ensures the conceptual completeness of the technical solution.
        * Works closely with project management to ensure alignment of plans with what is being delivered.
        * Analyzes the current architecture to identify weaknesses and develop opportunities for improvements.
        * Identifies and when necessary, proposes variances to the architecture to accommodate project needs.
        * Performs ongoing architecture quality review activities relative to specific project/programs they are responsible for.
        * Provides strategic consultation to clients and IT teams.
        * Advises on options, risks, costs versus benefits, system impacts, and technology priorities.
        * Consults on enterprise-facing projects and maintains knowledge of their progress.
