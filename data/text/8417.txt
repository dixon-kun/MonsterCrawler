        The School of Public Health (SPH) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) is excited to announce multiple tenure-track faculty positions associated with the newly formed Center for Precision Health at UTHealth. We are seeking candidates with experience and interests in emerging approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through analyzing individual, family and population variations in molecular, genomic, epigenetic data, and life-style data, and their interactions.
        These approaches may include:
        * Translational bioinformatics, with an emphasis on utilizing
        bioinformatics theories, methods, and tools to address clinical and
        health problems at the individual, family and population levels;
        * Genetic, especially DNA sequence, analysis to better understand
        inter-individual differences in disease risk across the life course,
        clinical outcomes, and response to treatment;
        * Epigenetic analysis, especially RNAseq and methylome analysis to
        better understand inter-individual differences in disease risk across
        the life course, clinical outcomes, and response to treatment;
        * Data sciences, with a focus on integrating, mining, and using
        heterogeneous genomic and other -omic datasets.
        Successful applicants will join a dynamic SPH faculty focused on research, education, and the practical application of informatics. RESPONSIBILITIES: Successful candidates will be expected to conduct research, participate in graduate level teaching activities, and provide service at the school, university, regional, national, and international levels. Collaborative research with other SPH faculty and across UTHealth and the Texas Medical Center is expected.
        SALARY: Competitive and dependent upon qualifications and experience.
        APPOINTMENT/BENEFITS: All positions are 12-month, full-time appointments in the tenure track.
