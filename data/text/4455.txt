        WANT TO REVOLUTIONIZE HIRING?
        Happie is a startup in the heart of Central Square in Cambridge, MA, on a mission to help people thrive in work and life. We're building a technology platform that is changing the way companies find, engage, and hire great talent.
        We are a quickly growing team of sales pros, marketers, and entrepreneurs going after a huge market by creating a company built on flawless design, advanced data science and an incredible customer and talent experience. We believe that if we fundamentally re-engineered hiring it would look and feel completely different than it does today for both sides of the hiring equation. That's what we're here to do.
        You should be excited about innovating in an archaic industry while greatly enjoying Happie hours, team lunches, and lots of hilarious interactions between team members.
