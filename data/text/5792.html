        <br/>
        * A fun, fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where employees are viewed as the company's greatest asset and critical to our success.
        <br/>

        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Global Collaboration: Video conferencing as well as mobile camera bots where remote employees can explore/interact throughout our open work space and into (hopefully invited) team meetings and doing so across many cultures. We also support community gaming however we find that most folks enjoy coding more than they do gaming! Go figure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Culture of 'Who we are as technologists': We are not the often over-used term of "IT" but rather we are Software Engineers forming the core of all product built and sold by Genscape. We are not a 'support function' in a retail, consumer or other hard-products business. Rather but rather are at the center of all that is created within Genscape which is software---not as a support function but developers are the core of all that is created at Genscape. We bring to life the product concepts, vision and details of world-class Energy product managers and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which is the perfect combination and one reason for build of quality product.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Being part of a team of extremely talented analysts, engineers, technologists, data scientists, user experience experts, QA practitioners and off-shore strategic development teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * A company that offers a strong focus on work life balance and encouragement to make a big impact where you work. As previously mentioned, many of our talent pool are both left-and-right brain balanced and are as comfortable at a keyboard cranking code as they are composing music, rock-climbing, leading a band, restoring snow cats, welding artwork or many other interesting hobbies.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We also support working from home and flexible work hours: This goes to supporting the self-motivated team member where we want folks who enjoy going 'above-and-beyond' as a standard because they simply 'are that way'. The result is high throughput, consistent delivery and a happy team!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * Excellent benefits and numerous perks including conferences, F2F training, online training and internal contests such as Technology Hackathons and Internal Innovation Competitions where we bring winning team concepts to life in product/technology.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        * We offer all of the above (and more) as we know you expect the most of us as a company and managers and we expect the most of you as an exceptional contributor! Apply if you want to join as an exceptional contributor to an awesome team---if you are looking for just another 'job in technology' and are at all a 'clock-puncher' then please pass on us.
