Do
you
crave
volumes
of
data
and
the
tools
and
resources
to
analyze
it
Do
you
delight
at
the
prospect
of
discovering_patterns
and
transforming
data
into
actionable
information
Do
you
love

Are

If

What
You'll
Do
At
the
core
of
LiveRamp's
products
is
a
massive
graph
that
connects
the
different
identifiers
for
each
person
their
online
devices
and
the
identifiers
that
100s
of
different
marketing
platforms
use
to
recognize
them
As
a
LiveRamp
Data
Scientist
you'll
analyze
the
complex
connections
in
this
half
a
trillion
node
graph
that
contains
PBs
of
data
from
over
a
1000
different_sources
To
work
with
this
massive
dataset
you'll
learn
cutting_edge
big_data
analysis
tools
eg
Redshift
and
Pregel
Using
the
results
of
your
investigations
you'll
further
develop
our
conceptual_framework
for
understanding
LiveRamp's
identity
graph
including
new
terminology
metrics
mathematical_models
visualizations
and
reports
Further
you'll
apply
this
conceptual_framework
to
create_new
data_refinement
strategies
that
filter
out
suspect
connections
to
further
enhance
the
quality
of
LiveRamp's
identity
graph
Types
of

Further
develop
our
conceptual_framework
for
understanding
and
making
quantitative
decisions
about
our
complex
and
massive
identity
graph
Including
the
development
of
new
terminology
metrics
mathematical_models
visualizations
and
reports
Of
paramount
importance
is
understanding
identity
accuracy
ie
correctness
and
reach
ie
completeness
how
many
people
can
we
match
Apply
this
conceptual_framework
in
the
development
of
data_refinement
strategies
that
enhance
the
accuracy
of
our
identity
graph
Explore
and
quantify
the
reach
and
accuracy
implications
for
incorporating
new
sources
of
identity
data
into
the
graph
Quantify
