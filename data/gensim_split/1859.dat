Cisco
worldwide_leader
in
networking
and
IT
is
increasingly
growing
into
all
aspects
of
the
security_space
As
the
Internet
of
Everything
grows
into
its
projected
19
trillion
market
each
element
must
be
secured
Cisco
is
building
an
interconnected
threat
intelligence
platform
to
safely
connect
these
devices
while
leaving
bad_actors
out
of
the
picture
The
Cisco
Talos
Security
Intelligence
and
Research
Group
detects
and
correlates
threats
in
real_time
using
the
world's_largest
threat_detection
network
protecting
against
known
and
emerging
cyber_security
threats
to
better_protect
the
Internet
Talos
is
seeking
puzzle-loving
coders
to
join
our
growing
Efficacy
Engineering
EE
team
of
research
engineers
and
data_scientists
We
find_patterns
in
mail
and
web
samples
and
telemetry
that
can
be
abstracted
into
broad
yet
accurate
threat_detection
content
and
then
automate
the
process
EE
invents
and
applies
techniques
in
applied_statistics
big_data
and
machine_learning
to
accomplish
this
Role
Responsibilities
Researchers
in
this
role
regularly
pour
through
our
corpora
of
telemetry
and
archived
messages
and
threats
seeking
patterns
that
identify
bad_actors
They
invent
novel_approaches
to
threat_detection
and
work
in
small_groups
to
build
detection
content
and
proof-of-concept
models
that
either
transition
to
internally
supported
tools
or
else
transition
to
our
software
teams
to
be
hardened
and
further
developed
based
on
guidance
provided
by
EE
Specific

Data

Good
