We
are
looking
for
an
experienced

enthusiastic
data_scientist
for
our
novel
general-purpose
AI
platform
Ourplatform
is
a
recommendation
and
decision
engine

builds
learning
knowledge_graphs
across
a
variety
of
information
classes
and
customer
verticals
The
platform
ingests
and
organizes
data
into
networks
involving
data
people
objects
and
actions
The
platform
learns
optimizes
and
provides
a
real-time
interaction
system
for
querying
recommendations
and
relations
along
with
dynamic
analytics
about
uncovered
connections

a
data_scientist
who
will
be
actively
supported
in
helping
to
organize
and
apply
best_practices
to
our
