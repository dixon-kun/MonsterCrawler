delivery
of
software
via
a
team
of
talented
application_developers
operating
in
a
number
of
SCRUM
teams
today
This
role_requires
collaboration
across
the
rest
of
the
technology
leadership
team
to
ensure_alignment
with
the
roadmaps
of
work_streams
including
database
development
devops
business_intelligence
QA
and
architecture
This
team
lead
will
work
with
the
across
the
organization
in
planning
design
development_testing
and
deployment
of
application
services
This
individual
will
need
to
be
a
strong_collaborator
and
communicator
as
they
will
work_closely
with
the
Product
Developers
to
ensure
that
the
engineers'_activities
are
in
line
with
the
larger_goals
of
Genscape's
growth
strategy
This
individual
will
also
work
with
the
other
members
of
the
Platform
team
to
establish
and
maintain
design
standards
to
ensure_compatibility
and
consistency
in
all
data
environments
The
role
is
a
hybrid
of
manager
and
hands-on
technologist
working
through
architecture
and
also
code-related
work_streams
Leading
a
global
team
on
a
day-to-day_basis
requires
the
hands-on
co-development
code_review
activities
to
provide
code-level
guidance
while
also
leading
from
a
SCRUM
Agile
delivery
perspective
The
role_requires
an
in-depth_understanding
of
code
management
activities
and
agile
deployment
methods
where
we
maintain
multiple
environments
across
Dev
QA
Test
Beta
Prod
etc
while
servicing
may
products
with
one
production
platform
The
activities
also
include
working
with
our
devops
team
on
the
continual
optimization
of
continuous_integration
Our
new
production
platform
is
cloud-based
and
highly_scalable
which
is
essential
for
our
platform
strategy
to
deliver
all
products
across
one
configurable
platform
There
are
a
variety
of
technologies
we
employ
with
the
vast_majority
being
open-source
across
the
full_stack
of
our
cloud-based
platform
The
Lead
will
manage
development
activities
with
the
full_spectrum
of
technologies
however
our
data
services
team
has
accountability
for
the
data
tier
and
we
include
our
database
resources
with
our
daily
SCRUM
standups
This
leadership
role
will
also
incorporate
and
embrace
our
off-shore
partners
working
around
the
globe
to
leverage
their
dev
QA
skills
on
the
SCRUM
teams
Support
activities
will
also
come
into
the
role
however
our
platform's
architecture
mitigates
many
of
the
typical
risks
seen
in
vertical
product
solutions
so
break-fix
will
be
only
a
small
portion
of
the
job
Our
Devops
group
handles
the
majority
of
support
however
some
issues
will
escalate
to
the
team

role
to
address
urgent
issues
with
the
team
We

engineers
who
love
to
innovate
and

about
software_development
in
all
layers
of
the
stack
Exceptional
software_developers
are
as
much_left-
as
they

given
the

and
development
Passion
for

drive_toward
excellence
of
solution
and
outstanding
team
collaboration
where
ideas
can
be
bounced_around
for

are
all
aspects
of
culture
we
embrace
If
you
see
software
as
a
direct_reflection
of
what
you
love
to
do
build
and
if
you
say
to
yourself
Imagine
