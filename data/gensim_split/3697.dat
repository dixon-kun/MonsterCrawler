We're
looking
for
a
brilliant
individual
with
deep_expertise
in
statistics
to
form
the
cornerstone
of
our
data_science
team
Our
process
gives
you
full_ownership
over
the
projects
you
tackle
so
dream_big
then
execute
well
Data
science
at
our
Startup
is
primarily
concerned
with
understanding
the
dynamics
of
our
large
about
15
million
matches
per_month
and
complex
about
140
000
active
markets
across
700
service
categories
and
10
000
US
cities
product
ecosystem
What
trends
are
occurring
in
the
market
What
drives
user_behavior
How
can
we
intervene
with
product
changes
to
guide
user
activity
This
generally
involves
careful
inferential
modeling
over
various
observational
datasets
and
challenging
experimental_design
and
analysis
It
usually
requires
much
deeper
statistical
understanding
than
just
applying
a
machine_learning
algorithm
at
a
problem
and
hoping
for
results
Naturally
in
the
course
of
things
some
more
ML-style
prediction
problems
do
come
up
You'll
work_closely
with
engineers
to
get
the
data
you
need
out
of
our
various
storage
layers
and
to
implement
experiments
in
our
production
systems
You'll
be
given
the
latitude
to
survey
our
company
as
a
business
identify_key
opportunities
and
use
any
and
all
available
data
to
draw
actionable
conclusions
that
will
guide
the
direction
of
the
company
Requirements
You
have
a
deep_understanding
of
probability
and
statistics
including
but
not
limited
to
experimental_design
randomization
and
blocking
error
types
and
loss
frequentist
vs
Bayesian
approaches
bootstrapping
and
simulation_modeling
including
techniques
for
nonlinear
responses
generalized_linear
models
and
model
selection
and
evaluation
confounding
and
effect
modification
propensity
scores
and
other
techniques
for
causal_inference
You're
proficient
with
statistical_analysis
in
an
environment
tool
language
of
your
choice
we
use
both
R
and
Python
Pandas
currently
and
are
comfortable
creating
repeatable
comprehensible
analyses
You're
comfortable_using
SQL
and
writing_efficient
code
to
handle
large
data_sets
on
a
single
machine
You
don't
need
to
be
comfortable
writing
MapReduces
If
you
have
those
skills
of
course
you're
welcome
to
apply
them
here
You
express
yourself
clearly
and
concisely
in
written
and
verbal
discussion
of
complex_problems
Responsibilities
You'll
conceive
of
and
answer_questions
about
our
product
ecosystem
using
observational
data
You'll
design_implement
and
launch
experiments
to
test
your
hypotheses
You'll
identify
and
implement
metrics
that
align
with
company
goals
You'll
contribute
to
our
Python
codebase
and
perform_analyses
in
R
or
another
statistics
tool
of
your
choice
You'll
advise
coworkers
on
the
mis
use
of
statistics
to
understand
data
Example
projects
Which
markets
in
our
ecosystem
are
most
healthy
Which
are
least
healthy
and
how
can
we
improve
them
Are
service_providers
becoming
more
or
less
engaged
with
our
company
over
time
What's
driving
these
changes
Which
consumers
are
most
delighted
by
their
experience
What
drives
the
differences
and
how
can
we
best
improve
the
experience
for
our
users
Are
some
service_providers
consistently
under-
or
over-charging
for
their
services
How
does
that
affect
consumer_behavior
Could
we
offer
advice
to
help
them
improve
their
businesses
What
drives
differences
in
quote
prices
across
consumer
requests
in
different
markets
How
well
can
we
predict
the
prices
a
consumer
will
get
