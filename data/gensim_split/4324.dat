The
Intelligence
and
Decision
Technologies
Group
develops
advanced
software
techniques
for
processing_exploitation
and
dissemination
of
data
from
many_types
of
sensors
including
radar
electro-optic
video
and
radio
frequency
as
well
as
from
people
and
the
Internet
The
goal
is
to
develop
and
prototype
analytics
and
architectures
that
support
decision_makers
This
work
begins
with
an
understanding
of
the
workflows
of
intelligence
analysts
and
military
commanders
often
through
operations_research
Operational
data_sets
are
amassed
to
support
all
types
of
algorithm_development
such
as
multi-sensor
fusion
data_mining
graph-based
network
detection
and
entity
tracking
An
agile_development
methodology
then
creates
prototype
systems
for
data
exploitation
and
knowledge
management
which
are
then
delivered
to
our
user_community
for
feedback
and
iterative_refinement
The
challenges
of
heterogeneous
sensor
systems
and
overwhelmingly
large
data
volumes
drive
experimentation
with
architectures
for
network-centric
exploitation
and
distributed_storage
and
computation
Areas
of
technical
staff
expertise
in
the
group
include
machine_learning
computer_vision
natural_language
processing
graph
analytics
distributed
software
systems
analysis
and
development
modeling
and
simulation
software_development
and
field
experimentation
A
research
position
is
currently_available
to
develop
automated
intelligence
systems
for
large
multi-sensor
and
open_source
data_sets
Projects
involve
system
design
and
architecture
and
the
development
of
algorithms
for
machine_learning
computer_vision
natural_language
processing
and
graph
analytics
implemented
on
enterprise
