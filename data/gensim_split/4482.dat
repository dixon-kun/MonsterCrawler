The
Dana-Farber
Cancer
Institute
seeks
a
POSTDOCTORAL
COMPUTATIONAL
BIOLOGIST
AND
DATA
SCIENTIST
FELLOW
under
the
Van
Allen
lab
and
the
Center
for
Cancer
Precision
Medicine
http

to
work
on
the
analysis
of
new
datasets
generated
in
the
context
of
multiple
clinically
oriented
cancer
sequencing
projects
in
order
help_advance
efforts
for
precision
cancer
medicine
The
qualified
candidate
will
specifically
focus
on
new
algorithms
for
the
clinical
integration
of
whole
transcriptome
RNA
sequencing
with
existing
exome
genome
DNA
sequencing
to
enable
new
discoveries
in
patients
under
multiple
contexts
The
candidate
will
also
evaluate
and
integrate_existing
tools
and
databases
into
high-throughput
pipelines
and
facilitate
the
display
and
the
distribution
of
processed
data
These
projects
include
Prospective
clinical
sequencing
to
guide
the
care
of
cancer_patients
Studies
of
RNA-based
drivers
of
cancer
development
and
treatment
response
alternative
splicing
differential
gene
expression
Studies
of
patient
samples
for
tumor
behavior
and
clinical
outcomes
in
context
of
immunotherapy
Creation
of
new
algorithms
that
effectively
integrate
RNA
sequencing
data
for
clinical
utility
These
projects
are
collaborative
efforts
between
the
Dana-Farber
Cancer
Institute
the
Broad
Institute
and
multiple
other
institutions
The
goals
of
this
initiative
consist
of
analyzing
sequencing
data
to
determine
the
effects
of
genomic
alterations
and
expression
changes
on
clinical
behavior
both
retrospectively
and
prospectively
These
new
data
could
help
identify
novel_approaches
for
personalized
care
in
oncology
In
addition
this
data
may
provide
support
for
new
methods
in
clinical
decision-making
biomarkers
for
rational
drug
development
and
new
insights
into
tumor
biology
through
innovative
analyses
The
person_hired
for
this
position
will
join
the
team
in
this
effort
and
will
participate
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
algorithms
to
analyze
the
data
and
integrate
with
other
data_sets
including
clinical
outcomes
data
This
person
will
also
help
with
the
generation
of
tools
needed
for
manipulating
and
preparing
data
for
display
transferring
data
to
external_collaborators
and
data
repositories
and
will
also
help
maintain
support
and
document
shared
tools
code_base
and
data_sets
As
the
software
infrastructure
evolves
this
position
is
likely
to
present
diverse
and
flexible
opportunities
-
from
deeper
