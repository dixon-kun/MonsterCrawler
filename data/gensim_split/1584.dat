people
will
learn
not

knows
it
best
today
Engineers
collaborate
across_departments

our
data_scientists
and
analysts
who
are
not

the
best
and
brightest
in
their
fields
but
are
also_eager
to
teach

learn
from

Finally
valuing_continuous
learning
also_means
recognizing
that
our
strongest_contributors
stand
out
for
their

their
credentials

smart
fun
and
a
little_bit
