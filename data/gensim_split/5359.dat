is
seeking
a
talented
experienced
and
highly_motivated
bioinformatician
data_scientist
with
a
keen_interest
in
translational
immunology
and
a
track_record
in
deriving
biological
insight
into
response
to
therapies
from
clinical
and
correlative
analyses
As
a
member
of
the
correlative
sciences
community
at
CCI
this
position
will
collaborate
very
closely
with
data_scientists
and
clinicians
in
PDCS
and
across
CCI
and
at
UPenn
and
domestic
and
international
collaborators
aimed
at
expanding
our
world-class
analytical
pipeline
in
support
of
ever-improving
patient_outcomes
and
scale-out
of
therapies
pioneered
at
UPenn
Our

with
cutting-edge
cellular
biochemical

molecular
analytics
including
RNA-seq
and
ATAC-seq
in
bulk

and
single
cells
and
high_dimensional
flow
and
mass

This
together
with
clinical
response
evaluations
and
laboratory
data
creates
unique
data_sets
for
the
exploration
of
the
spatiotemporal
dynamics
of
the
biomarkers
and
create

to
understand
the
biology
of
our
