Join
a
tight-knit_team
at
Microsoft
and
change
the
way_people
work
by
making
Yammer
a
better
product
At
Yammer
we're_building
software
that's_revolutionizing
the
typical
workday
Yammer
makes
it
easy
for
people
at
desks
on
planes
in
stores
and
all
over
to
tap
into
their
network
and
all
the
would-be
collaborators
and
hard-to-find
resources
across
their
organization
and
work_together
Yammer
relies
on
data
to
influence
decisions_across
the
organization
and
our
Analytics
Team
plays
a
central
role
in
making
that
happen
HERE'S
WHERE
YOU
COME
IN
We're
looking
for
Data
Scientists
who
want
their
work
to
have
an
impact
You've
got
a
brain
and
Yammer's
all
about
you
using
it
to
achieve
that
impact
If
you
enjoy
thinking
critically
questioning
assumptions
and
collaborating
with
intelligent
folks
we
think
you'd
also
enjoy
this
role
Here
are
a
few
reasons
why
we
love
this
job
Autonomy
We're
independent
thinkers
and
we
each
have
the
freedom
to
make
our
own
decisions
In
addition
we
each
own
our
projects
Teamwork
We
value
autonomy
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
work
alone
Each
analyst
has
unique
strengths
and
viewpoints
and
we
often
teach
each
other
new
skills
and
explore
alternative
perspectives
High
Expectations
Our
coworkers
rarely
ignore
our
analyses
Rather
they
poke
holes
in
them
and
challenge
us
to
produce
stronger
more
convincing
analyses
