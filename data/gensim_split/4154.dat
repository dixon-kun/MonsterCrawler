Protagonist
Technology
Protagonist
Technology
is
not
an
ordinary
analytics
company
or
an
ordinary
software
startup
At
the
core
of
our
unique
solution
is
a
rapidly
emerging
technology
category
called
Narrative
Analytics
This
unique
human-in-the-loop
technology
where
human
analysts
work
in
tandem
with
the
most
powerful
artificial_intelligence
algorithms
goes_beyond
basic
NLP
techniques
like
sentiment_analysis
text
categorization
etc
Narratives
are
underlying
beliefs
and
attitudes
that
drive
human_behavior
In
commerce
politics
and
society
media
voices
are
multiplying
facts
are
losing
their
currency
and
narratives
are
filling
the
void
to
drive
peoples
attitudes
and
behavior
Global
corporations
and
foundations
contend
with
narrative
challenges
that
pose
great_opportunity
and
also
existential
challenges
to
their
business
models
These
organizations
need
new_ways
to
change
the
conversation
build
their
brand
and
reputation
and
understand
and
activate
their
customers
We
are
the
only
company
to
bring
a
robust
data-driven
solution
to
the
analysis
of
narratives

Protagonist
Technology
we
have
10_years
of
experience
with
qualitative
human
analysis
of
narratives
and

deep
in-house
expertise
of
how
to
identify
analyze
structure
and
understand
narratives
in
news
and
social_media
We
marry
that
qualitative
expertise
with
deep_expertise
in
NLP
and
machine_learning
deep_learning
LSTM
etc
to
bring
scale
efficiency
and
new
insight
to
our
long-standing
methods
Through
this
process
we
deliver
a
more
nuanced
complex
and
valuable
set
of
insights
to
our
customers
than
traditional
NLP
and
analytics
companies
