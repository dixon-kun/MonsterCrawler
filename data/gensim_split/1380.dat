At
Civis
were
looking
for
great
software_engineers
with
particular
expertise
in
front_end
development
Our
Front
End
Engineers
are
responsible
for
the
user_interfaces
and
visualizations
of
our
data_science
products
and
can
often
be
found
working
on
our
highest
velocity
projects
We
rely
on
front_end
engineers
to
combine
science
beauty
and
function
to
ensure
a
clean
user
experience
What's
great
about
being
a
Front
End
engineer
at
Civis
We
believe
in
ownership
of
our
work
and
continuous_learning
and
we
run
our
team
to
reinforce
those
values
We
trust_engineers
from
all
over
our
team
to
pick
the
right
architecture
library
or
framework
for
the
job
at
hand
They
help
make_decisions
about
new
products
in
cross-functional
design_sprints
and
take_quarterly
hack_weeks
to
try
out
new_ideas
and
new_technologies
Civis
engineers
push
code
to
production
on
their
second_day
and
from
there
work
on
projects
chosen
to
gain
more
and
more
responsibility
right
away
We
want
to
never_stop
learning
Everyone
has
a
mentor
from
day
one
and
tracks
their
personal
development
alongside
their
technical
deliverables
We
staff
projects
based
on
what
people
will
learn
not
just
who
knows
it
best
today
Engineers
collaborate
across_departments
with
our
data_scientists
and
analysts
who
are
not
only
the
best
and
brightest
in
their
fields
but
are
also_eager
to
teach
and
learn
from
you
Finally
valuing_continuous
learning
also_means
recognizing
that
our
strongest_contributors
stand
out
for
their
capabilities
and
not
their
credentials
We
are
smart
fun
and
a
little_bit
weird
Does
this
sound_like
you
