There
are
three
reasons
why
the
strategically
hungry
come
to
Brooklyn's
Big
Spaceship
to
break_free
from
thinking-by-department
to
get
closer
to
making
and
to
work
with
clients
striving
to
recalibrate
their
businesses
We
believe
how
you
do
makes
what
you
do
That's
why
we
sit
in
teams
not
departments
That's
why
we
have
values
not
rules
That's
why
we
discuss
our
personal_aspirations
for
projects
before
they
start
If
we
can
get
it
right
on
the
inside
for
our
clients
and
our
own
company
then
we
believe
our
focus
on
solving
business_problems
by
solving
human
problems
will
thrive
What
we
need
in
you
We're
currently_looking
for
a
curious
down-to-earth
jargon-free
data
strategist

over
5_years
experience
Here's
what
we
need
in
you
You
grew
up
digital
This
isn't
about
spending
every
waking
hour
on
Twitter
It's
about
showing
that
you've
played
with
a
lot
of
the
digital
world
that
you've
experimented
and
learned
sometimes
for
work
sometimes
for
the
sake
of
it
You
grasp
the
fundamental_concepts
of
the
industry
You
know
how
an
insight
differs
from
an
observation
how
a
strategy
differs
from
principles
and
tactics
and
how
ideas
differ
from
executions
And
you
can
show
work
that
consistently
and
surprisingly
delivers
to
these
concepts
You
can
work
with
fellow
digital
grown-ups
We're
an
eclectic
mix
of
designers
technologists
strategists
and
producers
We
aren't
loud
and
we're_always
trying
to
achieve
something_new
and
powerful
together
The
skills
we'll
need
to
you
have

examples
of

and
to
create
strategies
that
have
ideas

and
social
data
thinking
into

media

what's
happening
online
and
why
you'll

great
content
in
the
analysis
and
on
face
value
Communications
and
experience
planning
You'll
know
how
to
orchestrate
an
idea
so
that
it
doesn't
just
launch
and
then
nothing
And

be
able
to
develop
people-centric
experience
plans
or
customer
journeys
