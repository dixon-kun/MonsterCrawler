Our
goal
is
to
make
the

genome
practically
useful
for
life-altering
decisions
We
invented
the
Counsyl

is
now
prescribed
by
physicians
for

Few
if
any
have
done
genetics
on
this
scale
before
As
a
data_scientist
you
will
play
a
critical_role
in
building
an
efficient
reliable
and
data-driven
vertically-integrated
genetics
organization
What
you'll
do
Build
structured
reports
that
can
be
automatically
re-run
to
monitor
critical
laboratory
parameters
for
process_control
and
regulatory_compliance
Statistical
modeling
and
process
debugging
to
develop
new_assays
and
new
technology
in
the
