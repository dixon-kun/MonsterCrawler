Who
We
Are
The
marketplace
team
oversees
the
twitter_ad
auction
which
serves_billions
of
ad_impressions
and
generates_millions

dollars
in
revenue_per
day
Our
goal
is
to
generate
the
maximum_value
possible
from
our
online_auction
by
matching_users
with
the
most
valuable
and
relevant_ads
We
design
and
implement
new
algorithms
for
ad_selection
and
ranking
eg
budget-aware
allocation
conversion
optimization
ranking
and
relevance
improvements
We
perform
extensive
experimentation
simulation
and
large-scale_log
analysis
to
improve
revenue
user
experience
and
advertiser_return
on
investment
