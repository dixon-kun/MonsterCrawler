What
we
do
Theres
someone
you
know
maybe
related
to
you
maybe
a
friend
maybe
a
colleague
maybe
yourself
whom
youve
seen
at
some
point
struggle
and
become
frustrated
with
the
question
of
what
am
I
doing
with
my
life
whats
my
path
This
might_start
early
say
in
college
when
one
has
the
opportunity
to
choose
from
1000s
of
courses
but
the
time
and
money
for
only
about
30-35
It
might_start
after
graduation
being
unable
to
figure
out
how
that
degree
and
those
courses
equate
to
the
qualification
requirements
or
job_descriptions
of
employers
It
might_start
after
a
few
years
of
work
realizing
the
present
path
is
just
not
the
right
path
but
not
knowing
what
else
there
is
or
how
to
find
it
SkillsEQ
wwwskillseqcom
is
taking
a
very
ambitious
approach
to
fixing
one
of
societys
most
enduring
market
failures
career_path
planning
and
management
There
are
thousands
of
companies
trying
to
address
parts
of
this
problem
but
its
mostly
a
case
of
old
wine
in
new
bottles
We
believe
we
have
the
solution
Weve
bootstrapped
everything
to
date
were
in
the
process
of
raising
a
seed
and
have
an
operational
1st
stage
product
in
place
-
now
its
time
to
aggressively
expand
that
products
capabilities
break
a
lot
of
stuff
learn
even
more
and
start
making
an
impact
on
peoples
lives
and
well-being
Why
youd
like
us
We
are
NOT
a
company
looking
for
data
analysts
We
are
NOT
a
company
looking
for
website
traffic
analysts
We
are
a
company
that
considers
our
data
our
product
This
is
a
genuine
data_science
role
whose
purpose
is
to
develop
the
models
and
algorithms
necessary
to
drive
our
service
This
is
one
of
the
most
important
central
roles
in
our
company
Weve
spent
time
in
corporate
environments
where
the
norm
was
meetings
about
calls
about
meetings
political
games
and
having
to
go
up
the
ladder
to
get
anything
done
-
we
commit
to
never
allowing
that
into
our
culture
We
strive
for
a
productive
fascinating
motivating
honest
open
flexible
smart
empowered
enjoyable
work
environment
One
of
our
primary
goals
is
to
create
a
company
recognized
as
a
leader
for
data_science
and
algorithmic
modeling
technical
elegance
and
sophistication
Wed
like
you
to
join_us
and
help
make
that
happen
