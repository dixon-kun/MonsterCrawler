anMIT
Media
Lab
spin-off
focused
on
understanding
human
emotion
and
using
that
understanding
to
improve
the
world
Our
vision
is
that
one
day
technology
will
have
the
ability
to
sense
adapt
and
respond
to
not
just
commands
but
also
non-verbal
signals
We
are
building
artificial
emotional_intelligence
As
you
can
imagine
such
an
ambitious
vision
takes
a
great
team
with
a
strong_desire
to
explore
and
innovate
We
are
growing
our
team
to
improve
and
expand
our
core
technologies
and
help
solve
many
unique
and
interesting_problems
focused
around
sensing
understanding
and
adapting
to
human
emotion
Our
first
technology
measures
human
emotion
through
remotely
sensing
and
analyzing
facial
expressions
This
technology
is
already
being
used
commercially
and
has
been
released
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
SDKs
so
that
developers
around
the
world
can
begin
to
use
it
to
create
a
new_breed
of
apps
websites
and
experiences
