About
ThousandEyes
The
name
ThousandEyes
was
born
from
two
big
ideas
the
power
to
see_things
not
ordinarily
possible
and
the
ability
to
collect
insights
from
a
multitude
of
vantage
points
As
organizations_rely
more
on
cloud
services
and
the
Internet
the
network
has
become
a
black_box
outside
of
their
control
ThousandEyes
gives
organizations
visibility
and
insight
into
the
now
borderless
network
It
arms
them
with
an
accurate
understanding
of
how
the
network
impacts
their
applications
users
and
customers
