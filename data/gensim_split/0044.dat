New
America's
Public
Interest
Technology
Fellowship
Program
is
an
ambitious
new
initiative_designed
to
support
an
emerging
public_interest
technology
sector
in
Americathe
application
of
technology
knowledge
skills
in
policy-making
and
public_service
to
help
solve
public
problems
Just
as
public_interest
law_became
an
esteemed_public
service
career_path
a
generation
ago
we
believe
public_interest
technologists
are
critical
to
our
future_prosperity
as
a
nation
What
do
we
mean
by
public_interest
technologists
We
cast
a
wide
net
Our
goal
with
the
Public
Interest
Technology
fellowship
is
to
find_bold
thinkers
that
want
to
join
the
work
of
building
an
ecosystem
of
engineers
data_scientists
software_developers
lawyers
economists
and
organizers
that
are
all
engaged
in
the
common
work
of
harnessing
the
power
of
technology
to
solve
public
problems
Public
interest_technology
is
not
simply
about
building
digital
systems
and
services
It
is
about
tackling_policy
challenges
that
are
directly
about
technology
or
shaped
by
technological
change
And
it
is
about
making
the
types
of
innovative_approaches
to
management
organization
and
problem_solving
that
are
emblematic
of
the
technology
community
available
to
those
seeking
to
make
or
influence_policy
at
every
level
We
will
have
two
rounds
of
applications
for
Public
Interest
Technology
Fellowships
The
application
deadline
is
March
15
2017
Through
this
initiative
fellows
will
advance
big
ideas
in
public_interest
technology
in
a
variety
of
ways
Proposals
can
be
for
a
short-term
or
part-time_project
3-9
months
Or
they
can
be
for
longer_term
full-time
and
in
depth_programmatic
work
12-18
months
We
envision
a
broad_typology
of
projects
that
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
these
examples
Exit
Fellowship

project
for
technologists_leaving
public_service

document_lessons
learned
analyze
challenges
articulate
aspirations
and
offer
training
for
the
next_cohort
of
public_interest
technologists
Parallel
Public
Service
a
project
designed
to
work
in
parallel
on
a
technology
issue
policy

the
relevant_institutions
to
test
ideas
develop
new
thinking
organizing
partners
and
help
deliver
better_outcomes
Community

project
that
experiments
with
leveraging
technology

projects

practice

its
capacity
