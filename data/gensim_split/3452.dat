Data
Science
in
a
nutshell
Here
at
Airbnb
we're
big
fans
of
travel
We
love
thinking
about
the
diversity
of
experiences
our
host
community
offers
and
we
spend
a
fair
amount
of
time
trying
to
make_sense
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
cities
where
people
are
booking
trips
every
night
If
Apple
has
the
iPad
and
iPhone
we
have
New
York
and
Paris
The
tricky
thing
is
most
of
us
haven't
been
to
Cuba
so
we
try
to
come
up
with
creative_ways
to
help_people
find
the
experience
they're
looking
for
in
places
they
may
have
never
been
The
data_science
team_works
in
tandem
with
product_management
engineering
and
design
teams
to
solve
for
things_like
this
Each
data
point
we
collect
represents
a
choice
by
a
user
-
creating
a
profile
on
our
website
searching
for
where
to
visit
choosing
the
right_place
to
stay
or
accepting
one
guest
over
another
Our
mission
is
to
understand
those
decisions
and
help
the
company
respond
to
them
effectively
In
some
cases
we
work
with
product
to
build
algorithms
that
learn
and
improve
over
time
in
others
we
research
concepts
that
can
lead
to
new
business
opportunities
and
foremost
we
strive
to
implement
rigorous
A
B
experiments
whenever
we
can
We
also
work
with
non-product
teams
like
marketing
public_policy
and
HR
Through
data
we
can
stay_connected
to
our
community
at
scale
and
doing
so
effectively
requires
hiring
the
right
people
