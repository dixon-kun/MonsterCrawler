Earnest
is
a
financial
technology

We
are
a

market
by

a
company_built
on
flawless
design
powerful
software

data_science
and
an
incredible
client
experience
We
believe
that
if
we
fundamentally
re-engineered
banking
it
would
look
and
feel
completely
different
to
how
it
does
today
and
that
is
what
we
have
set
out
to
do
Our
team
is
made
up
of
people
who
are
both
inspired
innovators
and
results_driven
--
individuals
who
are
prepared
to
roll
up
their
sleeves
to
challenge
the
status_quo
to
venture
far
beyond
what's
comfortable
and
who
are
able
to
fail
and
get_back
up
again
The
Role
We're
looking
for
an
experienced
and
creative
Senior
Data
Scientist

join
our
data
team
-
the
team
responsible

making
our
vision
a
reality
This
role
will
participate
in
all
stages
of
the
model
building
process
including
data_ingestion
and
model
deployment
The
models_built
by
the
Data
Science
team
at
Earnest
touch
all
arms
of
the
business

of
models

are
credit

Responsibilities
This
is
a
very
collaborative

The
business_needs

are
growing
rapidly

the

need
to
grow
and
adjust
to
those
changes
The
data
and
modeling
challenges
at
Earnest
are
unique
within
the
industry
so
standard
machine_learning
methods
won't
work
out
of
the
box
Custom
methods
will
most
likely
need
to
be
developed
and
deployed
from
scratch
so
creativity_innovation
and
a
fearlessness
with
respect
to
complexity
are
absolutely
essential
to
