Roche
Sequencing
Santa
Clara
is
developing
nanopore
technology
to
making
genetic
testing
easy
reliable
and
affordable
We
are
creating
a
revolutionary
low
cost
portable
DNA
RNA
reader
that
can
be
used
to
improve
the
lives
of
people
in
a
wide_variety
of
applications
including
the
timely
screening
of
newborns
for
diseases
and
the
diagnosis
of
cancers
and
infectious
diseases
Roche
is
looking
for
a
motivated
and
team-oriented
individual
who
is
passionate
about
revolutionary
sequencing
technology
As
a
data_scientist
algorithm
engineer
in
our
Statistical
Modeling
and
Analytics
Group
you
will
drive
critical_components
of
our
sequencing
technology
development
Your
role
will
involve
a
wide_variety
of
activities
related
to
base
calling
algorithm
engineering
system
simulation
and
analytics
In
developing
primary
data
analysis
algorithms
you
will
work
with
large
experimental
data_sets
generated
by
our
proprietary
instruments
A
firm_grasp
of
concepts
from
probability_theory
signal_processing
electrical
circuit
analysis
and
machine_learning
will
be
essential
for
guiding
algorithm_development
and
system
engineering
We
ultimately
must
turn
noisy
electrical
signals
into
accurate
DNA
sequences
We
also
provide
analysis
tools
and
strategic_guidance
to
other
R
D
groups
working
on
system
chemistry
and
hardware
An
additional
critical
function
in
this
role_involves
advancing
a
highly_accurate
system
simulator
and
utilizing
the
resulting
synthetic
data
as
a
supplementary
training
resource
Effectively
guiding
both
simulation
and
analysis
code
development
will
require
an
ability
to
grasp
the
physical
biological
and
electronic
characteristics
of
our
single_molecule
sequencing
system
Development
and
support
of
the
simulations
requires
a
candidate
that
is
self-motivated
and
able
to
work
well
in
an
agile_software
development
environment
Previous
experience
with
data
pipelines
will
be
very
helpful
as
well
To
this
end
you
will
be
working_directly
with
scientists
from
a
variety
of
fields
including
physics
biochemistry
electrical_engineering
and
software_engineering
The
successful_candidate
must
be
excited
to
learn_new
concepts
from
these
diverse
areas
and
apply
them
to
an
ambitious
interdisciplinary
project
Responsibilities
Include
Primary
data
analysis
algorithm
engineering
Application
of
statistical_models
to
characterize
stochastic
behavior
at
the
single_molecule
level
Enhancing
a
custom
simulator
platform
and
its
associated
data

Collaborating
with
scientists
from
a
diverse_set
of
fields
to
advance
system
characterization
statistical
tools
MUST
have
scientific_programming
experience
in
Python
especially_numpy
pandas
scikitlearn
matplotlib
or
the
equivalent
such
as
Matlab
and
C
C++
experience
and
willingness
to
learn
Python
MUST
have
a

MUST
have
some
experience
with
advanced_statistical
methods
clustering
Markov
models
neural_networks
regression_analysis
principal_component
analysis
MUST
be
excited
about
expanding
your
current_skill
set
If
a
new
tool
or
methodology
is
needed
you
will
have
the
flexibility
to
spend_time
learning
about
it
and
apply
it
to
the
project
A
basic_understanding
of
analog_electronic
circuits
is
a
plus
Experience
with
distributed_computing
