The
Oracle
Data
Cloud
isan
industry_leader
in
connecting
online
and
offline
data
to
execute
and
measurethe
effectiveness
of
marketing
initiatives
To
enable
these
insights
theODC
relies
on
the
power
of
the
Oracle
Identity
Graph
to
connect
thousands
ofdisparate
data_sources
to
create
comprehensive
and
accurate
anonymized
profilesacross
the
numerous
ID
spaces
where
marketers
are
trying
to
reachconsumers
These
ID
spaces
include
butare
not
limited
to
email
mobile_phones
tablets
computers
TVs
and
postaladdress
Creating
these
anonymized
profiles
in
a
privacy
safe
and
accuratemanner
is
foundational
to
building
targeting
audiences
at
scale
as
well
asdetecting
a
clear
signal
when
measuring
the
effectiveness
of
any
campaign
The
ODC
ID
Graph
is
madepossible
because
of
a
lot
of
data
and
a
lot
of
data_science
As
a
Senior

team
you'll
be
involvedin
developing
a
best-in-class

You
will

ultimately
you
will
also

how
it
is
