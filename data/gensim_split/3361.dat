Team
The
Einstein
Data
Science
team
at
Salesforce
is
looking
for
Lead
Data
Engineers
to
help_us
take
one
of
the
world's
most
extensive
data_sets
and
transform
it
into
amazing_products
that
feel_like
magic
A
typical_day
for
you
might_include
the
following
Developing
data
infrastructure
that
is
able
to
ingest
and
transform
data
at
huge_scale
coming
from
many_different
sources
different
customers
and
in
many_different
varieties
Developing
machine_learning
infrastructure
that
can
generalize
across_hundreds
of
thousands
of
Salesforce
customers
but
is
expressive
enough
to
actually
generate
high
lift
Brainstorming
data
product
ideas
with
the
data_scientists
and
engineers
that
built
some
of
the
most
exciting
data
products
that
hundreds
of
millions_people
use
every_day
Working
with
internal
product
teams
to
ingest
their
data
and
sprinkle
machine_learning
fairy
dust
on
their
products
Participating
in
meal
conversations
with
your
team_members
about
really
important
topics
such
as
Should
the
cuteness
of
panda
bears
be
a
factor
in
their
survivability
Is
love
a
decision_tree
or
a
regression
model
How
far
ahead
would
society
be
today
if
we
had
12
fingers
instead
of
10
What
we
care
about
We're
a
growing_diverse
team
and
we
work_together
on
projects
We
love
to
collaborate
and
help
each
other
and
we
want_someone
to
share
that
ideology
You
have
to
be
a
very
quick_learner
-
we
face_new
challenges
every_day
anything
that
ranges
between
the
operating_model
of
a
financial_services
companies
to
how
to
make
Spark
work
with
the
S3
file_system
No
school
could
prepare
you
for
all
of
these
so
you
need
to
be
very
quick
on
your
feet
We
develop
real
products
You
need
to
be
an
expert
in
coding
We
use
Scala
and
functional
programming
principles
great
if
you
do
too
or
are
willing
to
learn
We
have
massive_scale
You
need
to
have
experience
in
distributed_scalable
systems
Consistency
availability
tradeoffs
are
made
here
You've
tinkered
with
modern
data
storage
messaging
and
processing
tools
Kafka
Spark
Hadoop
Cassandra
etc
We
run
on
AWS
We
dockerize
applications
You
should
have
some
notion
of
how
to
build
test
and
deploy_code
to
run
on
cloud_infrastructure
You
have
to
be
self_sufficient
-
we
operate_like
a
startup
so
everyone
might
do
a
bit
of
everything
to
get_things
done
You
have
to
want
to
make
a
difference
-
we
don't_like
status_quo
We
are
looking
for
people
who
want
to
excel
at
everything
they
do
while
still
being
able
to
prioritize
between
the
must-haves
and
nice-to-haves
