ABOUT
AFFIRM
At
Affirm
we
are
using
technology
to
re-imagine
and
re-build_core
parts
of
financial
infrastructure
to
enable
cheaper
friendlier
and
more
transparent_financial
products
and
services
that
improve_lives
We
believe
the
financial_industry
is
fundamentally
broken
Not
only
is
the
core
infrastructure
built
with
technology
from
the
1970s
but
there
are
a
dwindling_number
of
people
who
say
I
trust
my
bank
to
look
out
for
me
It
doesnt
have
to
be
this
way
and
its
our
mission
to
fix
this
problem
