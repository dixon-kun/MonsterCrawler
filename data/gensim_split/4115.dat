Netflix
is
revolutionizing
the
way
entertainment
is
consumed
by
people
all
over
the
world
We
are
also
changing
the
kinds
of
entertainment
people_watch
with
groundbreaking
new
titles
and
formats
We
are
still
in
the
beginning
stages
of
our
journey
to
become
the
biggest
and
most
data-driven
studio
the
world
has
ever_seen
and
we
need
a
talented
data_scientist
to
help_us
take
it
to
the
next
level
When
we
decide
how
to
promote
content
to
our
members
we
do
it
through
rigorous
experimentation
and
deep_dives
into
user_behavior
As
a
data_scientist
on
the
Science
Algorithms
team
you
will
answer
through
experimental_design
statistical_modeling
and
analysis
questions
such
as
What
is
the
best
way
to
build
excitement
for
our
titles
before
they
launch
on
the
service
How
can
we
design
algorithms
to
find
the
right
target_audience
for
our
titles
knowing
we
have
multiple
new
titles
launching
every
week
How
can
we
push
the
bounds
of
video-based
features
to
promote
titles
in
a
way
that
feels
as
cinematic
as
a
trailer
in
the
movie
theater
Can
we
use
big_data
to
unlock
the
mystery
of
word-of-mouth
and
influencer
impact
