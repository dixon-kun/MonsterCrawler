At
Netflix
we
don't
just
deal
with
huge_scale
we
deal
with
a
huge
diversity
of
scale
We
run
thousands
of
applications
on
our
back-end
cloud
systems
We
serve_hundreds
of
thousands
of
TV
shows
and
movies
to
millions
of
customers
across
millions
of
devices
distributed
across
thousands
of
device
families
all
of
which
are
constantly_evolving
and
changing
The
Real-Time
Analytics
group
at
Netflix
builds
systems
which
continuously
use
diverse
telemetry
sources
within
our
environment
to
sift
through
millions
of
signals
and
arrive
at
actionable
high-confidence
decisions
about
what's
going
on
in
our
environment
and
what
we
should
do
about
it
Some
work
we've_already
talked
about
publicly
and
would_like
to
open-source
includes
1
Noticing
when
one
out
of
thousands
of
servers
is
misbehaving
based
on
Outlier
Detection
and
automatically
replacing
it
with
a
new
server
2
Automatically
detecting
whether
new
code
deployed
to
production
is
at
least
as
performant
and
correct
as
baseline
code
and
either
accelerating
deployment
globally
or
rolling
it
back
3
Automatically
monitoring
for
health
of
applications
and
alerting
users
when
the
application
skews
from
normal
behavior

We
see
huge
opportunities
for
using
RTA
decisions
to
drive
automated
systems
both
to
improve
our
ecosystem's
self-healing
capabilities
but
also
to
make
it
easier
for
engineers
to
understand
what's
most
important
for
them
to
look
at
automatically
deduce
correlation
and
causation
and
notice
the
most
minute
imperceptible
changes
in
our
streaming
environment
before
our
customers
do
Our
analytics
engineers
build
models
that
take
advanced_statistical
analysis
approaches
and
machine_learning
techniques
to
provide_recommendations
or
in
many
cases
make
decisive
automated
action
in
managing
the
production_environment
If
extracting_meaning
out
of
a
whole
lot
of
data
AKA
noise
is
fascinating
to
you
we
should
talk
If
you
like
deducing
and
understanding
control_system
patterns
we
should
definitely
talk
