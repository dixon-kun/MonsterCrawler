What's
great
about
being
an
engineer
at
Civis
We
believe
in
ownership
of
our
work
and
continuous_learning
and
we
run
our
team
to
reinforce
those
values
We
trust_engineers

all
over
our
team

the
right
architecture
library
or
framework
for
the
job
at
hand
They

Civis
engineers
push
code
to
production
on
their
second_day
and

ramp
up
on
projects
of
increasing_responsibility
Were
looking
for
senior
engineers
to
make
a
big
impact
in
their
first
few
months
We
want
to
never_stop
learning
Everyone
has
a
mentor
from
day
one
and
tracks
their
personal
development
alongside
their
technical
deliverables
We
staff
projects
based
on
what
people
will
learn
not
just
who
knows
it
best
today
Engineers
collaborate
across_departments
with
our
data_scientists
and
analysts
who
are
not
only
the
best
and
brightest
in
their
fields
but
are
also_eager
to
teach
and
learn
from
you
Finally
valuing_continuous
learning
also_means
recognizing
that
our
strongest_contributors
stand
out
for
their
capabilities
and
not
their
credentials
We
are
smart
fun
and
a
little_bit
weird
