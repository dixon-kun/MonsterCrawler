business
people
and
designers_set
on
creating
and
building
products
that
transform
the
way
we
and
our
clients
do
business
Sure
we
are
part
of
a
large
financial_services
firm
operating
in
a
highly-regulated
environment
and
that
means
we
are
not
as
flexible
or
agile
as
your
average_company
let_alone
a
startup
But
we
are
careful_stewards
of
our
clients
trust
and
money
and
combine_creativity
and
speed
with
discipline
and
awareness
It
also_means
that
what

build
matters

huge_impact

our
1000s

the
world
and
affect
how
JP
Morgan
does
business
from

in
multiple
markets

a
day
We
wont
build
it
unless
we
know
it
is
scalable
We
are
obsessed
with
effectiveness
productivity
and
efficiency

we
find
an
issue
or
broken
process
we
fix
it
We
work
with
the
right
tools
make_decisions
quickly
and

pursue
those
ideas
that

and
meet
our
clients

our
business
critical
needs

a
fascinating_time

thrive
in
the
years
to
come
We
