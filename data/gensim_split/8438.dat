ORCL
is
funding
an
ambitious
initiative
to
acceleratecancer
research
The
Oracle
Cancer
Research
Cloud
OCRC
will
provide
cancer
researchersa
private
cloud
and
a
shared
data_warehouse
in
which
to
conduct
their
researchThe
data_warehouse
will
be
prepopulated
with
large_volumes
of
genomic
data
andother
cancer
related
data
In
return
Oracle
data_scientists
will
curate
andanonymize
research
data
and
add
it
to
the
data_warehouse
This
will
expand
theknowledge
base
available
to
other
academic
researchers
as
well
as
pharmaceuticalresearchers

Ourgoal
is
to
use
our
vast
infrastructure
to
make
research
more
efficient
butalso
to
provide
the
means
for
all
cancer
clinicians
to
have
access
to
thelatest

so
they
can
deliver
the

They
will
develop
ETL

datapipeline
jobs
to
