such
as
Kanban
Our
teams
embrace
SCRUM
across
the
board
and
across
all
global_offices
which
is
both
exciting
and
challenging
but
we
enjoy
continuous_improvement
and
honing
our
software
delivery
excellence
This
team_member
will
work
with
the
SCRUM
teams
in
planning
grooming
stand-ups
retrospectives
etc
all
of
the
usual_key
Agile
SCRUM
meetings
This
individual
does
not
need
to
be
senior_however
they
must
be
very
well
seasoned
at
SCRUM
Master
methods
operations
techniques
and
will
need
to
be
a
high_energy
strong_collaborator
and
communicator
as
they
will
work_closely
with
the
Product
Developers
Product
Owners
and
Data
Owners
to
ensure
that
the
team
activities
are
in
line
with
the
larger_goals
of
Genscapes
growth
strategy
This
individual
will
also
work
with
the
IT
support
team
to
continually_improve
and
optimize
our
software_development
workflow
and
tools
optimization
activities
to
ideally_suit
our
app-dev_software
team
As
one
would_expect
with
any
seasoned
SCRUM
Master
the
individual
is
intended
to
protect
the
interests
agreements
of
the
development
team
while
serving
and
supporting
the
overall_project
This
means_sufficient
seniority
maturity
to
push_back
on
product_owners
where
appropriate
to
protect
the
efficiency
and
delivery
excellence
of
the
overall
SCRUM
team
for
each
sprint
The
role
must
also
collaborate
with
product_owners
in
an
effective
and
strategic
way_hence
the
human_aspect
of
people
management
and
collaboration
across_many
geographies
is
essential
The
role
serves
as
the
nucleus
of
the
delivery
ecosystem
We
enjoy
engineers
who
love
to
innovate
and
are
remarkably_passionate
about
software_development
in
all
layers
of
the
stack
This
also
applies
to
our
agile
delivery
practitioners
We
enjoy
and
appreciate
the
optimization
process
for
expedient
accelerated
delivery_cycles
Do
we
need
to
become_excessively
short
in
our
sprints
No
However
we
wish
those
sprints
to
be
the
right
balance
of
strategic
and
tactical
to
support
customers
in
the
near-
and
long-term
Organization
is
a
key
characteristic
of
a
strong
SCRUM
Master
as
well
as
living
the
model
of
supporting
the
team
while
the
team
supports
you
as
their
champion
for
delivery
operations
Product
Owners
are
also
critical
to
the
SCRUM
cycles
so
having
a
good
working_relationship
is
key
there
Objectivity
is
key
and
we
ensure
our
Product
Owners
are
organizationally_separate
from
our
SCRUM
Masters
reporting
into
the
CTO
organization
Passion
for
software

are
all
aspects
of
culture
we
embrace

a

of
what
you
love
to
do
build
and
if
