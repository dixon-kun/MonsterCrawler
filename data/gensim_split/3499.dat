Riot
Games
was
established
in
2006
by
entrepreneurial_gamers
who
believe
that
player-focused_game
development
can
result
in
great
games
In
2009
Riot
released
its
debut_title
League
of
Legends
to
critical
and
player
acclaim
As
the
most
played
PC
game
in
the
world
over
100_million
play_every
month
Players
form
the
foundation
of
our
community
and
it's
for
them
that
we
continue
to
evolve
and
improve
the
League
of
Legends
experience
We're
looking
for
humble
but
ambitious
razor-sharp_professionals
who
can
teach_us
a
thing
or
two
We
promise
to
return
the
favor
Like
us
you
take_play
seriously
you're_passionate
about
games
We
embrace
those
who
see_things
differently
aren't_afraid
to
experiment
and
who
have
a
healthy_disregard
for
constraints
That's
where
you
