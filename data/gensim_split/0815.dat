We
are
looking
for
a
talented
Data
Scientist
to
ensure
that
we
serve
up
the
best
video
at
the
best
time
to
every_single
Spiral
viewer
As
part
of
our
mission
to
inform
inspire
and
educate
the
world
with
great
video_content
we
want
our
video
feed
to
adapt
to
each
users
personal
patterns
and
preferences
In
practice
this
means
building
out
video
rankings
recommendation_systems
and
predictive
algorithms
for
watching
behavior
depending
on
time
location
social
signals
and
previous
activity
Our
ideal_candidate
is
comfortable
in
a
fluid
fast-paced_startup
environment
and
will
bring
an
energetic
fun
and
creative
approach
to
their
work
You
should
have
experience
building
product_features
from
the
ground
up
and
not
be
afraid
to
make
iterative
moves
or
deal
with
imperfect_data
You
should
be
comfortable
running
side-experiments
to
determine
the
optimal_approach
while
working
with
engineering
to
contribute_directly
to
production_code
And
while
you
should
be
comfortable
with
large_datasets
you
should
also
be
ready
to
make
an
impact
while
the
data
is
still
limited
As
our
first
Data
Scientist
you
will
determine
the
quality
of
the
watching
experience
for
Spiral
What
you'll
be
doing
Work
closely
with
product
and
other
members
of
engineering
to
apply
machine_learning
Design
and
run
iterative
experiments
to
determine
the
best
approach
to
relevance
ranking
Enable
improved
contextual
recommendations
and
content_discovery
What
you
have
Advanced
degree

a
Data
Scientist
or
Data
Engineer
Extensive
experience
in
NLP
video
analysis

and
or
bayesian
inference
Comfortable
with
all
the
usual
SQL
