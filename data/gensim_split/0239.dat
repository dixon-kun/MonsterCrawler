Who
You
Are
You
love
people
After
all
the
art
of
marketing
is
in
creating_experiences
that
people
will
remember
and
talk
about
with
their
friends
You
are
a
connector
You
look
for
opportunities
to
put_people
together
so
they
can
form
new
relationships
and
you
aggressively_look
to
broaden
your
own
network
within
the
company
You
know
that
the
key
to
being
effective
in
any
role
is
understanding
who
the
various
internal
and
external_stakeholders
are
so
you
work_hard
at
it
You
are
a
communicator
Let's
be
honest
If
you're
not
clearly_communicating
what
you're_trying
to
do
whether_it's
internally
or
externally
you're_going
to
fail
So
you
work
at
it
You
are
a
great
writer
you
use
visuals
and
you
are
comfortable_talking
to
a
group
inspiring
them
to
action
You
also
like
data
You
know
that
the
numbers_aren't
always
the
whole
truth
but
they
give
you
insights
You're
not
afraid
of
math
or
statistics
You
know
how
to
use
Excel
-
well
You
are
an
execution
fiend
You
prioritize_relentlessly
as
you
see
the
connection
between
what
you
are
doing
today
and
what
will
or
will
not
happen
in
a
week
a
month
or
a
year
You
see
the
dominoes
and
you
know
which
ones_need
to
be
knocked
down
first
to
achieve
the
strategic_objective
and
desired_outcome
And
you
are
passionate
Passionate
about
marketing
but
also
passionate
about
the
business
transformation
that
the
world
is
currently
facing
and
you
want_nothing
else
but
to
be
at
the
epicentre
of
it
all
You
aren't_afraid
to
work_hard
heck_really
hard
because
you
know
that
the
process
of
transforming
business
isn't
for
the
weak
or
the
faint
of
heart
You
don't_mind
it
you
seek
it
out
Bring
it
on
you
say
But
even
if
you
have
that
are
you
ready
for
Sprinklr
Truth
is
it's_simply
not
for
everyone
We
runhard
The
deal
you
make
is
an
investment
of
total
passion
and
commitment
to
the
cause
and
clientele
and
a
personality
that
says
If
I'm
not
being
challenged
it's
not
worth
my
time
Or
perhaps
you
might
say
Go
Big
or
Go
Home
Whatever
you
say
you
know
that
you
are
different
from
most
of
your
contemporaries
And
you're_prepared
to
grit
it
out
because
your
experience
is
that
when
you
do
the
rewards
are
worth
it
Odds
are
there
are
only
a
few
people
like
you
Put
simply
you
feel
a
calling
to
be
part
of
something
special
