Why
are
Software
Engineers
in
Portland
important
at
Airbnb
We
recently
kicked
off
a
new
initiative
of
distributed
engineering_teams
at
Airbnb
There
is
much
more
that
we
want
to
build
and
so
much
that
we
could
improve
We
value
strong
engineers
who
are
agile
enough
to
jump
into
projects
across
all
areas
of
the
stack
Frontend
Backend
Machine
Learning
or
Full
Stack
Our
first
remote
engineering
office
will
be
in
Portland

currently
house
a

Customer
Experience

thought
that

product
goes
into

around
the
company

applications
with
an

codes
with
some
of
the
newest
and
most
diverse_set
of
technologies
within

real_time
chat
and
notifications
to
