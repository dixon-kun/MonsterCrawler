As
a
member
of
the
Scientific
Data
Analysis
team
you
will
explore
and
develop
machine_learning
and
other
advanced
analysis
approaches
for
drug_discovery
applications
You
will
identify
tractable
machine_learning
problems
in
all
stages
of
drug_discovery
from
understanding
basic
disease
biology
to
target
identification
assay
development
safety
and
patient
stratification
Working
with
drug_discovery
teams
and
computational_biology
colleagues
you
will
frame
key
questions
define
appropriate
data_sets
and
perform
data
analysis
on
these
projects
You
will
be
a
part
of
teams
that
bring_together
leading
bench
scientists
software_engineers
statisticians
and
bioinformaticians
to
make_sense
of
large_scale
experimental
data
A

problems
3Exploring
and
understanding
relevant
datasets
both
those
generated
internally
and
those
from
the
public
domain
4Communicating
