SeatGeek
operates

unique
business
model
in
a
complicated

market
Many
of
the
hardest
problems

face
have
never
been
tackled
at

and
do
not
have
clear
questions
let_alone
answers
Moving
forward
requires

our
excitement
at
providing
data
services
to
our
colleagues
and
customers
someone
proficient
with
at

general-purpose_programming
language
and
who
knows
its
scientific
stack
We
want_someone
who
can
take
a
messy
dataset
and
make
it
clean
and

What
you'll
be
doing
As
a
member
of
the
SeatGeek
data_science
team
you
will
take
the
complex_issues
facing
the
business
and
make
them
simple
We
aim
to
find
meaning
in
the
data
we
have
go
out
and
get
the
data
we
don't
We
leverage
technology
whenever
possible
and
we
strive
to
build
systems
that
anticipate
the
needs
of
tomorrow
as
well
as
solving
the
problems
of
today
Here
are

things
you
might

statistical
tests

listing
will
sell
at
a
