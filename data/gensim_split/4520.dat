is
hiring
Alice
is
a
project
to
direct
Artificial
Intelligence
towards
economic
decision_making
nbsp
We

tools
that
combine
state-of-the-art_machine
learning
with
econometrics
to
bring
automation
to
economic
decision_making
nbsp
The
heart
of
this
project
is
a
striving
to
measure
causation
if
you
want
to
understand
or
make
policy
decisions
in
a
complex
economy
you
need
to
know
why
the
system
moves
the
way
it
does

nbsp
The
Alice
project_allows
us
to
dramatically
scale
the
success
that
we've
had
in
adapting
existing
ML
technology
for
economic
applications
and
in
developing
new
deep_learning
architectures
for
causal_inference
nbsp
All
our
research
is
tied
to
concrete
policy-relevant
applications
including
work
on
demand
estimation
and
price
optimization
on
measuring_effectiveness
of
advertising
and
sales
strategies
and

use
AI
to
improve
and
democratize
economic
research
while
taking
from
economic
theory
to
push
the
frontier
of
AI
