This
person
will
be
joining
the
Quantitative
Research
and
Analytics
QR
A
team
to
support
their
Linux
Unix
servers
This
is
a
unique
position
in
that
they
will
be
collaborating
with
a
separate
Unix
team
who
actually
owns
the
hardware
but
responsible
for
the
user
centric
administration
The
machines
are
used
by
the
Data
Scientists
on
the
team
but
the
support
they
get
from
the
unix
team
is
not
sufficient
for
their
needs
So
this
person
will
be
responsible
to
the
usual
troubleshoot
and
server
performance
but
only
in
terms
of
the
Data
Scientists
needs
solving_problems
such
as
how
to
get
the
data_scientists
the
right
packages
setting
up
the
correct
firewall_rules
for
their
needs
and
removing
any
other
barriers
They
trick
as
that
since
they
will
not
own
the
hardware
they
do
not
have
the
root
access
that
is
typically
for
most
administrators
Instead
they
must
collaborate
with
the
unix
team
and
be
the
voice
for
the
QR
A
team
Strong
communication
documentation
skills
and
user-centric
mentality
is
necessary
for
this
person
to
succeed
