Who
are
we
The
Natural
Language
Processing
NLP
group
-
a
group
of
specialists
researchers
and
software_engineers
who
have
a
passion
for
solving_complex
NLP
problems
Our
main
task
To
extract_relevant
meaningful
tradable_information
pricings
earnings
major
events
from
news_articles
in
real-time
Since
customers_rely
on
this
information
to
make_swift
financial
decisions
we
need
to
guarantee
precision
accuracy
and
latency_beyond
most
academic
and
industry
demands
We
are
building
new
NLP
models
for
name_entity
recognition
disambiguation
and
syntactic_parsing
of
social_media
and
other
difficult_news
sources
The
infrastructure
and
algorithms
we
develop
are
used
across
the
company
by
data_scientists
For
example
our
ML
team
leverages
our
work
to
extract_sentiment
analysis
from
social_media
We
are
also
building
LibNLP
a
platform
for
all
NLP
tasks
which
we
hope
to
eventually_open
source
