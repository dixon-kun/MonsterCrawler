Genia's
mission
is
to
make
genetic_information
universally
available
Our
proprietary
integrated
circuits
and
NanoTag
chemistry
enable
massively_parallel
single-molecule
DNA
sequencing
This
versatile
nanopore-based
platform_allows
for
single_molecule
electrical
real-time
analysis
without
the
need
for
complicated
optics
labels
or
amplification
By
developing
a
true
integrated
circuit
on
standard
semiconductor
technology
Genia's
platform_enables
the
use
of
molecular
diagnostics
in
everyday
clinical
care
Genia
Technologies
was
founded
in
March
of
2009
and
is
headquartered
in
Santa

California
Genia
was
acquired
by
Roche
in
June
of
2014
The
data_science
group
here
is
not
like
those
at
other
companies
We
generate
and
process_massive
amounts
of
sequencing
data
on
a
system
designed
and
built_in-house
from
the
ground
up
As
a
Data
Scientist
at
Genia
you
will
be
performing
analysis
to
drive
development
of
our
sequencing
technology
The
successful_candidate
must
be
excited
about
learning
new
concepts
from
chemistry
physics
algorithm_development
and
electrical_engineering
and
applying
them
to
an
interdisciplinary
project
The
majority
of
your
time
will
be
spent
aggregating
analyzing
and
summarizing
the
output
of
DNA
sequencing
experiments
You
will
also
be
responsible
for
updating
maintaining
and
testing_portions
of
our
automated
analysis_pipeline
Responsibilities
Include
Using
command_line
tools
to
perform
data
conversion
and
analysis
Supporting
other
team_members
in
retrieving
and
archiving
experimental
results
Quickly
writing_scripts
to
automate_routine
analysis
tasks
Creating
insightful
simple
graphics
to
represent
complex
trends
Who
you
are
You're
someone
who
wants
to
influence
your
own
development
You're
looking
for
a
company
where
you
have
the
opportunity
to
pursue
your
interests_across
functions
and
geographies
Where
a
job_title
is
not
considered
the
final_definition
of
who
you
are

the
starting
point
Skills
MUST
have
scientific_programming
experience
Matlab

scientific
stack
is
a
strong
plus
Demonstrated
ability
to
track
and
work
with
100s-1000s
of
files
and
GB-TB
of
