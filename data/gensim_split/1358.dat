What
You'll
Do
You
will
be
involved
in
overseeing
the
technical
architecture
product_development
and
technical
operations
for
the
solution
You
will
drive
the
choice
of
technologies
for
the
solution
to
scale
balancing
development
speed
with
operational
scale
and
maintenance
overhead
When
needed
you
will
roll
up
your
sleeves
and
write_code
to
make
a
quick
bug
fix
or
write
a
proof
of
concept
to
evaluate
a
new
technology
component
You
should
be
well_versed
with
enterprise
software
architectures
cloud
technologies
DevOps
and
Continuous
Delivery
domains
You
will
work
with
internal
McKinsey
teams
implementing
the
solution
at
a
client
development
teams
to
guide
product_development
and
our
clients
using
the
solution
You
should
have
a
real
passion
for
software_development
We
expect
that
you
will
have
contributed
to
open_source
projects
have
participated
in
technical
communities
and
interest
groups
and
perhaps
have
even
spoken
or
published
on
your
area
of
expertise
Despite
having
over
5
to
7_years
of
experience
a
Technical
Architect
at
McKinsey
will
still
be
an
active_learner
-_tinkering
with
new
libraries
and
using
unfamiliar
technologies
without
a
lot
of
supervision
Lastly
you
should
also
have
a
strong_understanding
of
Agile
and
other
best-practice
development
patterns
