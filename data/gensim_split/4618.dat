group
a
Neuroscience
lab
in
the
Department
of
Organismic
and
Evolutionary
Biology
and
the
Center
for
Brain
Science
at
Harvard
University
is
hiring
a
Scientific
Programmer
to
build
and
maintain
a
computational
infrastructure
for
acquiring
analyzing
and
storing
large
neuroscience-related
datasets
You
will
be
an
integral_member
of
a
collegial
research
team_focused
on
solving
intriguing
mysteries
of
the
brain
through
cutting-edge
research
The
ideal_candidate
will
have
a
strong_background
in
scientific_programming
using
one
of
the
following
C
C++
C
F
or
Fortran
and
have
experience
with
python
and
interacting
with
databases
Our
research
focuses
on
Uncovering
the
neural
mechanisms
that
allow_us
to
learn
and
execute
motor
skills
We
use
rodents
as
a
model
system
and
train
our
experimental
subjects
on
various
motor
tasks
while
measuring
and
manipulating
activity
in
the
underlying
neural
circuits
We
develop
automated
and
high-throughput
methods
for
recording
and
manipulating
nervous_system
activity
In
particular
we
have
pioneered
a
system
for
continuous
and
long-term
recording
of
large
neuronal
populations
in
behaving
animals
We
are
also
developing
new
data
analysis
approaches
to
extract_information
from
the
large
data_sets
we
acquire
and
to
identify
principles
of
how
the
brain
works
