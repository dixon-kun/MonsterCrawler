Research
organization
we

We
are
looking
for
strong
analysts
in
a
data_science
field
with
a
passion
for
extracting_insights
from
large

We
work
on
problems
that
cut_across
all
aspects
of
AT
T's
business
including
network
and
service
management
marketing
and
customer
care
network
design
and
optimization
and
new

creation
Many
analysts

leaders
All
have
opportunities
to
invent
novel
publishable_methodology
that

problems
Increasingly
we
contribute
to
multiple
data_science
disciplines
through
open_source

Spatiotemporal
analysis
of
mobile

The
AT
T
network_generates
billions
of
records_per
day
from
handheld
devices
each
one
providing
a
data
point
in

Understanding
the

of
this

improve
its

Statistical
computation_-
AT
T
is
developing_high-performance
statistical_models
and
algorithms
mostly
in
R
to
leverage_modern
streaming

is
modeling_free-form
text
from
millions
of
customer
surveys
representative
notes

as
one
way
to
manage
our
business
in

New
methods
are
needed
to
keep
up
with
the

of
this

Data
visualization
-
AT

in
interactive_visualization
of

Database
management

quality
-
AT

These
systems
are
critical
for
accurate_processing
and
analysis
of

mobile
network
Analyzing
the
data
to
identify

and
cleaning

are
essential
to
