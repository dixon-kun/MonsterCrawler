Summary
The
National
Renewable
Energy
Laboratory
is
looking
for
a
Chief
Theorist
in
materials
science
to
build
on
its
strong
tradition
in
the
application
of
advanced
theory
and
computation
to
problems
in
renewable_energy
and
energy
efficiency
as
well
as
emerging
programs
in
the
integration
of
theory
and
experiment
to
accelerate
materials_discovery
and
development
The
candidate_would
also
be
the
group
leader
of
a
theory
group
within
the
Materials
and
Chemical
Science
and
Technology
Directorate
responsible
for
technical_leadership
management
and
professional
development
of
solid-state
theorists
We
seek
highly_motivated
candidates
with
a
demonstrated_track
record
to
contribute
to
current
programs
and
with
a
vision
to
develop
new
programs
and
new_directions
in
materials
science
theory
We
seek_candidates
with
a
deep_knowledge
of
fundamental
theoretical
science
and
its
application
to
important
problems
in
materials
science
with
the
capability
and
interest
to
work
across
the
fundamental
and
applied
energy
space
Candidates
should
have
a
demonstrated_ability
to
initiate
and
execute
programs
in
areas
related
to
NREL's
mission
and
broad
research
portfolio
The
successful_candidate
will
develop
and
apply
predictive
theories
and
new
theoretical
methods
to
the
study
of
novel
functional
materials
with
properties
relevant
to
energy
conversion
storage
utilization
or
efficiency
and
will
work_closely
with
NREL
senior_management
theorists
and
experimentalists
to
develop
and
execute
new
research
directions
Research
areas
would
utilize
high_performance
computing
to
address
electronic
structural
vibrational
optical
or
magnetic
phenomena
and
properties
of
materials
at
the
atomic
nano-
or
meso-
scale
Research
areas
of
interest
include
but
are
not
limited
to
materials_discovery
opto-electronic
materials
functional
materials
quantum
materials
strongly
correlated
electron
systems
or
dynamic
phenomena
including
transport
of
atoms
charge
or
spin
as
well
as
phenomena
on
ultrafast
time
scales
The
position
will
likely_involve
a
joint
appointment
at
one
of
the
universities
within
the
Colorado
front
range
Excluded
research
areas
are
those
focusing
exclusively
on
organic
materials
soft
matter
and
biophysics
