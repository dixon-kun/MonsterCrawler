throughout

organization
While
some
people
find
this
responsibility
daunting
there
are
some
who
view
it
as
exhilarating
like
you
Signs
that
you're
right
for
this
job
Working
with
insanely
talented_people
brings
out
the
best
in
you
You
suffer
from
an
incurably
low
tolerance
for
boredom
New
ideas
and
technologies
excite
you
-
sharing
them
with
others
energizes
you
You
have
little
respect
for
the
status_quo
Deep
down
you're
secretly
a
nerd
okay
fine
maybe
it's
not
that
big
of
a
secret
Absolutely
Critical
to
Success
First
and
foremost
you
are
a
problem_solver
-
You
are
comfortable
coding
and
using
statistical_methods
but
they
are
just
a
means
to
the
end
You
creatively
apply
the
tools
and
techniques
that
you
are
familiar
with
and
proactively_pickup
new_ones
along
the
way
Insatiable
curiosity
It's
one
thing
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions
but
you
take
things
a
step
further
You
devour
new
areas
of
knowledge
and
lunge
headfirst
into
new_technologies
however
you
rarely
spend
enough
time
to
master
either
As
soon
as
you
learn
enough
to
be
dangerous
something_new
piques
your
interest
and
you
start
all
over
again
You
deliver
-
In
any
given
project
there
are
dozens
of
things
that
go
wrong
Rather
than
wait
for
problems
to
sort
themselves
out
you
combine
tenacity
strong
work-ethic
and
creativity
to
blow
through
roadblocks
and
deliver
