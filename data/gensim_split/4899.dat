wwwvideatv
is
a
well-funded_start-up
under
Cox
Media

Lenox
Mall
We
have
created
an
automated

advertising
that
is
revolutionizing
this
multibillion_dollar
media
ads
industry
We
currently
have
a
need
for
a
Hadoop
Backend
Engineer

join
our
R
D
team
where
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to
stay
on
the
cutting_edge
of
new_technologies
and
approaches
by
implementing
systems
that
enable
our
data_scientists
to
reason
about
and
explore
large
data_sets
Our
R
D
team
writes
the
math
and
software
that
sit
at
the
heart
of
Videa's
data
products
Our
software
runs
over
complex
time-series
data
that
is
growing
geometrically
in
size
and
variety
We
are
quickly
transitioning
from
batch
to
online
learning
approaches
to
accommodate
new

largely
dictate
what
projects
you
will
tackle
The
common_thread
among
all
projects
is
that
they
require
a
high_level

engineering
and
data
management
prowess
due
to
the
complexity
of
our
challenges
and
growing
scale
of
our
data
We
are
especially_interested
in

continue
to
improve
our
Hadoop
infrastructure
and
its
interfaces
Current
projects
include
Developing
new
and
enhancing
our
current
data
pipelines
Employing
machine_learning
into
these
pipelines
and
plugging
statistical_modeling
into
our
current
predictive
ratings
and
pricing
models
Creating
systems
that
monitor
inputs
and
performance
on
a
real-time
basis
to
inform
stakeholders
when
unexpected
changes
arise
Responsibilities
Design
and
build
systems
that
ingest
clean
and
transform
data
for
use
by
our
data_scientists
and
their
models
Implement
new
Hadoop
infrastructure
as
well
as
