the
need

Data
Science

data_science
team
is
like
a
startup_within
a
secure
established
companyThe
team_consists
of
deep
mathematical
analysts
architects
and
analytic
business
consultants
The
mathematical
analysts
typically
our
PhD's
predict
variables
of
interest
before
those
variables
are
known
The
analytic
business
consultants
take
the
prediction
and
turn
it
into
business
value
in
the
form
of
insight
product
enhancement
or
product
ideation
and
development

Director
Data
Science
will
have
knowledge
and
skills
in
math
business
and
architecture
complemented
by
robust
organizational
acumen
They
will
understand
our
customer's
processes
know
how
the
insight
can
improve
or
disrupt
those
processes
then
recognize
and
communicate
the
value
to
be
gained
by
recommendations
The
director
must
be
able
to
work_alongside
the
mathematicians

bring
their
models

the

via
systems
He

will
put

in

and
efficiency
from

Go
To
Market
every_step
