The
Structural
Genomics
Consortium
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
SGC-UNC
and
the
Laboratory
for
Molecular
Modeling
at
the
UNC
Eshelman
School
of
Pharmacy
are
interested
in
recruiting
a
postdoctoral
fellow
in
computational
chemical
genomics
The
project
entails
the
rational
expansion
of
the
GSK
Published
Kinase
Inhibitor
Set
PKIS
to
enrich
the
current
collection
of
de-orphanized
human
protein
kinases
and
unique
chemical
probes
for
thus
kinase
library
Working
with
researchers
at
SGC-UNC
as
well
as
SGC
collaborators
worldwide
the
successful_candidate
will
develop
comprehensive
chemical
genomics
database
of
human
protein
kinases
and
their
inhibitors
develop
new
scheme
for
automated
detection
of
kinase
subfamiliy
-specific
chemotypes
and
develop
predictive
understanding
of
structure-activity
and
structure-selectivity
relationships
for
kinase
inhibitors
to
identify
selective
kinase-specific
putative
probe
compounds
The
ultimate
objective
of
this
computational
project
is
to
prioritize
new_compounds
for
experimental
testing
This
postdoctoral
fellow
position
will
be
part
of
a
multidisciplinary_team
that
includes
biologists
chemists
and
data_scientists
The
ideal_candidate
will
have
significant
expertise
in
bioinformatics
and
cheminformatics
working_knowledge
of
multivariate_statistical
and
data_mining
techniques
and
strong_programming
skills
Experience
with
developing
and
maintaining
large_databases
is
a
plus
