The

to
leverage
the

As
reflected
in
the
design
document
FIRE
is
a
complex
system
with
many_components
dependent
on
one_another
This
is
particularly
true
for
the
extract_transform
load
ETL
processes
Data
from
disparate
data_sources
must
move
through
a
number
of
ETL
zones
eg
landing
staging
zone
data_warehouse
DW
reporting
before
it
can
be
used
effectively
Performing
analytics
may_require
modifications
enhancements
including
the
creation
of
new
data_structures
new
ETL
processes
and
new
data
dissemination
solutions
The
addition
of
new
components
could_affect
existing
components
and
must
be
addressed
carefully
