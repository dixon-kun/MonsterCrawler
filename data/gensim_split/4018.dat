About
the
Job
The
data_science
group
here
is
not
like
those
at
other
companies
We
generate
and
process_massive
amounts
of
sequencing
data
on
a
system
designed
and
built_in-house
from
the
ground
up
As
a
Bioinformatics
Data
Scientist
at
Roche
Sequencing
Santa
Clara
you
will
design
and
analyze_experiments
to
drive
development
of
our
sequencing
technology
and
apply
it
to
a
wide_range
of
applications
The
successful_candidate
must
be
excited
about
learning
new
concepts
from
both
life
and
physical_sciences
and
applying
them
to
an
interdisciplinary
project
The
majority
of
the
time
will
be
spent
designing
and
analyzing
experiments
to
better_understand
DNA
sequencing
experiments
This
involves
isolating
specific
components
of
the
system
as
well
as
seeing
how
different
combinations
behave
with
an
eye
on
making
the
output
as
useful
as
possible
for
the
different
use_cases
research
clinical
etc
You
will
also
be
responsible
for
updating
maintaining
and
testing_portions
of
our
automated
analysis_pipeline
Responsibilities
Design
and
analyze
statistical
experiments
with
various_groups
to
better
characterize
DNA
sequencing
process
Design
metrics
and
reports
to
summarize
complex
trends
in
performance
of
sequencing
Improve
and
maintain
bioinformatics
and
main

Quickly
write_scripts
to
automate_routine
analysis
tasks
Experience
with
scientific_programming
Python
Matlab
R
etc
is
a
must
Experience
with
analysis
of
high_throughput
biological
data
Experience
with
next_generation

WHY
WE'RE
A
GREAT
COMPANY
Genias
mission
is
to
make
genetic_information
universally
available
Our
proprietary
integrated
circuits
and
NanoTag
chemistry
enable
massively_parallel
single-molecule
DNA
sequencing
This
versatile
nanopore-based
platform_allows
for
single_molecule
electrical
real-time
analysis
without
the
need
for
complicated
optics
labels
amplification
or
fluidics
By
developing
a
true
integrated
circuit
on
standard
semiconductor_process
technology
Genias
sequencing_platform
enables
the
use
of
molecular
diagnostics
in
everyday
clinical
care
