Description
Atmospheric
and
Environmental
Research
AER
has
an
opportunity
for
a
satellite
data_assimilation
scientist
to
support
the
NOAA-NESDIS
activities
in
cloud-
rain-
and
ice-
impacted
radiance
data_assimilation
in
operational
Numerical
Weather
Prediction
NWP
models
Current
approaches
discard
satellite
data
that
are
impacted
by
rain
and
ice
and
to
a
certain
extent
cloud
This
screening
prevents
the
current
assimilation
system
from
taking_advantage
of
the
information
content
in
the
satellite
measurements
in
the
regions
of
high_importance
to
forecasts
To
mitigate
this
problem
the
Joint
Center
of
Satellite
Data
Assimilation
JCSDA
is
accelerating
the
development
of
methods
to
assimilate
cloud
precipitation
impacted
microwave
radiances
The
work
facility
is
located
in
the
state-of-the-art
NOAA
Center
for
Weather
and
Climate
Prediction
NCWCP
building
in
College
Park
Maryland
AER
assimilation
scientists
work
in
diverse
areas
including
radiative
transfer
sensor
simulation
characterization
of
atmospheric
and
surface
properties
from
space-based
observations
cloud
analysis
and
more
AER's
assimilation
work
assignments
are
interesting_challenging
varied
and
rewarding
We
are
seeking
self-motivated
candidates
with
abilities
to
work
in
a
team
environment
and
independently
This
project
requires_specialized
experience
in
physical
science
mathematics
and
computer_science
in
at
least
some
of
the
following_areas
modern
data_assimilation
methods
eg
variational
and
Kalman
filtering
physically-based
remote_sensing
assimilation
of
satellite
data
in
NWP
models
including
forward
operator
error
characterization
and
data
quality_control
variational
retrieval
methods
Experience
with
at
least_one
satellite
remote_sensing
data
set
is
required
An
advanced_degree
in
meteorology
atmospheric_sciences
applied_mathematics
or
a
similar_field
is
required
Because
software
and
tools
developed
at
the
JCSDA
are
primarily
composed
of
modern
FORTRAN
bash
scripts
and
IDL
proficiency
in
these
are
desired
AER
offers
a
competitive
wage
and
benefit_package
AER
is
an
equal_opportunity
employer
and
all
qualified_applicants
will
receive_consideration
for
employment_without
