Who
we
are
The
Health
Usage
and
Behavior
HUB
team
at
Twitter
works
to
measure
and
understand
the
satisfaction
and
motivations
of
our
users
From
modeling
individual
user_behavior
to
characterizing
user
populations
our
work
informs
product
and
marketing_strategy
and
helps
power
core
systems
at
Twitter
To
develop
a
deep_understanding
of
our
users
we
use
statistical_modeling
machine_learning
data_mining
time_series
modeling
and
many
other
analytical_techniques
we
build_prototypes
and
we
perform
experiments
all
applied
at
the
scale
of
Twitter
What
you'll
do
You
will
work
as
an
integral_part
of
our
data_science
team
to
develop
and
implement_algorithms
and
systems
that
can
be
applied
at
scale
to
Twitter
data
Examples
of
the
kind
of
work
you
might
do
include
developing
and
running
time-series_models
on
user
log
data
large-scale_graph
and
matrix
factorization
and
building
APIs
to
interface
with
other
parts
of
the
Twitter
stack
To
do
all
this
you'll_work
with
both
engineers
and
data_scientists
on
the
team
and
elsewhere
at
Twitter
Who
you
are
You
like
building_robust
systems
that
can
handle
large_datasets
and
plug
into
production
systems
but
you're
also
excited
about
quickly_prototyping
and
iterating
new
systems
to
test
out
an
idea
for
a
model
or
algorithm
If
you're
a
systems
engineer
excited
about
data_science
and
machine_learning
or
challenges
like
the
Netflix
prize
this
could
be
the
job
for
you
You
